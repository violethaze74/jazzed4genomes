REITZ NATIVE LAND

It has long been a foremost question among the many Reitz people, especially of the present
generation, from what land or country their ancestors came. Pioneer Johan Friedrich Reitz, the
progenitor of most of the Reitzes in Lehigh Co., Pa. and adjacent parts elsewhere, who landed at
Philadelphia, Pa. Sept. 7, 1748, came from the southwestern part of Germany. We consider
ourselves very fortunate in having secured copies of the official records tracing the Reitz lineage
completely back to 1690, some of which will be presented in this book. Johan Friedrich Reitz
emigrated in 1748 from Florsbach, at that time in the principality of Hanau, but now (1930) in the
District of Gelnhausen, Reg. Bez. Kassel, Province of Hessen-Nassau, belonging to Prussia,
Germany; and from thence he came to Philadelphia, Pa. The location is several miles east of the city
of Hanau and about 40 miles east of the large city of Frankfurt-on-the-Main, Germany. The
Germans kept very complete and satisfactory records for centuries, especially in their churches where
clergymen were paid state officials whose duty, among other things, was to make and preserve careful
complete family records.

1690 GENEALOGY

The ancestors of the Pioneer Johan Friedrich Reitz, who came to Philadelphia Sept. 7, 1748,
as taken from the official records of the Florsbach and Kempfenbrunn Lutheran Church Parish, in
the District of Gelnhausen, Hessen-Nassau, Germany.
JOHANNES REITZ, was the great-grandfather of Johan Friedrich Reitz, and lived at 1690
at Rohrig, in the Biebergrund parish, District of Gelnhausen, and not far from Florsbach, which is
several miles east of the city of Hanau, Germany.
JOHANNES REITZ, son of Johannes Reitz of Rohrig, now belonging to the Bieber
Lutheran Church, in the district of Gelnhausen, and Anna Barbara Friedrich, daughter of Stoffel
Friedrich of Lohrhaupten, Seulbach, held their engagement services Jan. 15, 1690, and their
marriage ceremony Feb. 11, 1690. They were the grandparents of Pioneer Johan Friedrich Reitz.
JOHANNES PETER REITZ, (also called Hans Peter, Johann Peter, or only Peter), son
of Johannes and Anna Barbara (Friedrich) Reitz, of Rohrig (now Bieber Luth. Church) Gelnhausen,
born Dec. 3, 1690, baptized the same day, the sponsor being Peter Freund, son of Hans Freund (a
smith or tailor). Married Jan. 4, 1715 Magdalena Weygand, born on the day of Simonis and Judae,
1687, daughter of Niclas Weygand, of Lohrhaupten, baptized on the same day, the sponsor being
Magdalena, housewife of Peter Kesler. Johannes Peter Reitz died and was buried Dec. 2, 1732, aged
41 years. His wife Magdalena (Weygand) Reitz died and was buried A.D. 1740, aged 53 years.
They lived at Lohrhaupten and were the parents of Johan Friedrich Reitz.
JOHANN FRIEDRICH REITZ, (the Pioneer) son of Johannes Peter and Magdalena
(Weygand) Reitz of Lohrhaupten, Gelnhausen, born and baptized Aug. 22, 1721, the sponsor was
Joh. Friedenberger, single; married Nov. 29, 1746, during public service in the church, Anna
Margaretha Steigerwalt of Florsbach; she was born and baptized Feb. 20, 1719, the sponsor being
Anna Margaretha, the wife of Henrich Samers of Florsbach. He was a mason by occupation. They
lived at Florsbach til they emigrated to Pennsylvania in 1748.
Rev. George Maldfeld, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran parish of the churches of
Kempfenbrunn and Florsbach, writes as follows: "Florsbach, Kempfenbrunn , Lohrhaupten in former
times belonged together as one parish. These places and Bieber (with Gassen and Rohrig-
Biebergrund) are the only Evangelical Lutheran Parishes in Spessart in this part of the country; they
belonged formerly to the Earldom, of Hanau, while now they belong to the District of Gelnhausen.
In Lohrhaupten the name Reitz has all died out, while in Florsbach it appears manifoldly yet at this
day. The name was also brought over from Rohrig to Lohrhaupten only through the marriage of Joh.
Reitz to that place, while it has remained in Florsbach, even though it is not found there before
1745."
From the church records at this place it is clearly established that the emigrant Johann
Friedrich Reitz emigrated from Florsbach in 1748 with his wife and only one child. This child, a
little son (Johann Henrich?) as verified by the church record was born Feb. 12, 1747, only one year
before their emigration. The church records also show that Johann Friedrich Reitz, son of Johannes
Peter (also called Hans Peter, Johann Peter, or only Peter) and Magdalena (Weygand or Weigandt)
Reitz, had yet four brothers of whom the name of one was Johann George Reitz, born Feb. 5, 1726.
The official church records of Kempfenbrunn and Florsbach also state that "In the years
1748 to 1754 and in 1766, 167 persons emigrated to Pennsylvania from Florsbach and
Kempfenbrunn, or from 1748 to 1754, 90 persons (1748, 22 persons; 1749, 2; 1750, 24; 1751,
32; 1752, 2 and 1754, 8), and in 1766, 77 persons." This reduced the population of these two

CONDITION OR DESCRIPTION OF THE NATIVE HOME

Of the Reitz Ancestors in Europe. A few words on the subject may be appreciated. The
country in Europe where many of the immediate Reitz Ancestors lived two to three centuries ago, was
mostly a country of farming district with small towns or villages like Florsbach, Kempfenbrunn,
Rohrig, Lohrhaupten, Bieber, etc. situate several miles east of the city of Hanau, in Gelnhausen
District, Province of Hessen-Nassau, Germany. A description of their country verifies the tradition
among their descendants here in Pennsylvania, that they came from a hilly and mountainous country
just like many parts here in Pennsylvania. There were many hills and beautiful narrow valleys, good
springs and many delightful creeks like the Florsbach Creek (the name implying flowery brook) and
also some high mountains. At some places the soil described sandy and naturally not very fertile.
There dense forests on the mountains, where there were berries much like we find on our mountains.
The people had small houses, often built with stone, with a simple fireplace of stone (hearth)
leading up a chimney, where they cooked on a tripot or with iron kettles hung on a hook above the
fire. They had small fields and their cultivating tools were primitive. The inhabitants were generally
poor. It is related that in the Spring many of the men would go away to cities and other industrial
places to earn some money while the women and children attended to the work at home on their
small farms during the Summer. Their taxes were often exorbitant, and frequently royal decrees
restricted their free and reasonable pursuit of life, liberty and happiness. Regardless of all hardships,
they prospered, and some had evidently saved enough money to emigrate and make the long and
hazardous journey to Pennsylvania. It is no wonder that such sturdy energetic laborious people made
so many prosperous homes here in Pennsylvania and promoted a numerous frugal industrious worthy
progeny. The description tells us they were a very religious people, had for centuries everywhere their
church and a schoolhouse aside it, where a thorough education, especially morally, was strictly carried
on. A picture of the little church at Florsbach is presented in this book, a little Lutheran Church,
which is said to be standing already for about 500 years, being renewed from time to time as in 1728
and 1928. It is the same church building which our ancestor Johan Friedrich Reitz and family
attended before they came to Pennsylvania and where they were married Nov. 19, 1746. The Reitz
ancestors seem to have dwelled for centuries in that District of Gelnhausen, as called now, to the
East of the city of Hanau of which principality it was formerly a part. They generally adhered to the
Evan. Lutheran church. Evidently not all the Reitz people in olden times lived in the hilly country
to the east of the city of Hanau. Some lived in other places like in Fulda. Persons who visited
recently over there report that many with the name Reitz are living at this day in the cities of Hanau
and Frankfurt-on-the-Main. History informs us that in olden times the Reitz people in Europe were
a noble people, regardless of the fact that some were poor. Some were poor. Some were university
professors, clergymen, physicians, state officials and princes. They had their Reitz Knights. They had
their "Coat-of-Arms", and armorial insignia, of which several are mentioned in old European records
and histories. A picture of one of them is presented herewith. From their original habitation near the
city of Hanau they scattered to all parts of the earth.

ORIGIN OF THE NAME REITZ. The Reitz people living over there in the city of Hanau,
Germany, have a tradition as to how the name REITZ originated. It is given herewith for what it is
worth. The tradition runs as follows: In olden times there were no surnames, and persons were known
by only one name, like in the time of Christ we speak of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. But in the
course of time surnames were acquired in addition to the first names for better designation.
Frequently the father's names was used. The tradition has it that several centuries ago there appeared
near the city of Hanau and old man with a long white beard riding a noble horse, who had escapes
from somewhere in the East, might have been last from Saxony, on account of religious persecution,
and who rode on his horse about the country, advocating especial freedom of religion and admonished
the people everywhere in religious assemblies in their free country. They knew him as the
"Reitczaronitsch" or the riding czarewitch, that is the riding son of the czar or prince, or a rider of
noble birth. His children were known as John or Jacob, etc. von Reit-czaronitsch, or Reit-czargeburt,
of noble birth. Some time later the hind part of czaronitsch or czargeburt was dropped and only the
"z" was retained and pronounced in addition to the "Reitz", leaving the name "Reitz", which
thereafter became the common adopted surname of the Reitz clan.

REITZ. This is a name now numerously represented in Washington,Little Mahanoy and Lower Augusta townships, as well as in various otherportions of Northumberland county, founded in that section in the middleof the eighteenth century by one George Reitz, who settled in Washingtontownship among the earliest pioneers of that region. The members of thefamily from that time to the present have been ranked among thesubstantial, respected, public-spirited and altogether desirable citizensof this favored community, prospering by industry, supporting thechurches and all enterprises which have for their object the uplifting oftheir fellow men and the advancement of the general welfare, and in theirindividual lives upholding the best traditions of the
forefathers who helped to found the best institutions of this part ofPennsylvania.
George Reitz, the pioneer of this family in Northumberland county,settled in Washington township among its earliest residents and was alarge landowner there, his original tract including the land now embracedin the farms of Luther Rebuck, William Rebuck, Harvey Rothermel, CharlesB. Hetrich and A. C. Adams. He is buried in an unmarked grave near afence, in the orchard on the farm now owned by C. B. Hetrich. Among hischildren were sons Andraes and Michael. Floyd, p269 and 787
The first members of the Reitz family to come to America - came toPennsylvania, settling in what was then Tulpehocken township, Berkscounty. Among these were the families of George, Peter and JohannesReitz, supposed to have been brothers. In 1759 we find one Daniel Reitz,Sr., paid 20 pounds tax, and another Daniel Reitz paid 2 pounds tax, inTulpehocken township. Floyd, p463

PIONEER JOHAN GEORGE REITZ
of near Rebuck, PA
at the Swabian Creek
Northumberland County, PA

PIONEER JOHAN GEORGE REITZ, progenitor of most of the Reitz people of Northumberland
and adjacent counties of Pennsylvania, was a brother of Johan Friedrich Reitz, the ancestor of most
of the Reitzes of Lehigh and adjacent counties of Pennsylvania, of whose descendants this book is
mostly written. Johan George Reitz was a son of Johannes Peter (also called Hans Peter, Johann
Peter, or only Peter) and Magdalena (Weygand) Reitz, of Lohrhaupten, District of Gelnhausen, in
the Province of Hessen-Nassau, Germany. The country district is several miles east of the city of
Hanau, to which it formerly belonged, and about 40 miles east of the large city of Frankfurt-on-the-
Main, Germany. For more description refer to the beginning of this book under the subjects "Native
Land" and "Genealogy" of Johan Friedrich Reitz, which applies also to him. He was born at
Lohrhaupten, Gelnhausen, Hessen-Nassau, Germany, Feb. 5, 1726, as the Lutheran Church
records show at that place, and which also show that in addition to his brother Johan Friedrich Reitz,
there were yet three other brothers. He also emigrated to Pennsylvania and sailed on the Ship Duke
of Bedford, and landed at Philadelphia, Pa., Sept. 14, 1751, as the Penn. Archives at Harrisburg,
Pa., show; where an examination disclosed that in taking the Oath of Allegiance he made his mark
to his name which the clerk misspelled "Ritz" instead of "Reitz". Some time later he settled on a
large farm at the Swabian Creek, about half a mile east of what is now Himmels Church, near
Rebuck, Northumberland Co., Pa. Penn. Archives show land warrants by George Reitz in
Northumberland Co., Oct. 14, 1772, 200 acres; Sept. 16, 1773, 50 acres. He and his wife
engaged in farming, and at death were buried on their farm. They had a family of sons and daughters.
We have record of two:
1. Andreas Reitz, b. Jan. 1, 1755; d. mar. 16, 1837.
2. Michael Reitz, b. Jan. 1757; d. Dec. 17, 1825.
They were Lutherans, and it is reported they were instrumental in organizing and building
the original Himmels Church, near Rebuck, Pa. Evidence points to their influence and prominent
religious character, because two large tombstones mark their graves in the first row near the Himmels
church in the Church cemetery.

[Transcription Note: At this point, Appendix II is divided into 2 sections, the first dealing with
Andreas Reitz and his descendants, the second with Michael Reitz and his descendants. For our
purposes, the second section will be transcribed here, leaving the first to be done at a later date.]

left for a future and more complete edition. During the past years the descendants of the two brothers
Johan Friedrich Reitz, of Lehigh Co., Pa., and Johan George Reitz, of Northumberland Co., Pa.,
have very agreeably made the acquaintance and association of each other, and many of both clans
