2 CONC  while not listed we know that at least two teenage sons and at least

2 CONC ave been other children and a wife but we're not sure. (the first time
2 CONC  one is mentioned is second wife.) Not long after arrival, The George
2 CONC Brosius family are found settled as farmers on a 205 acre tract, locat
2 CONC ed on the north east branch of Swatara Creek in Tulpehocken Twp., Lanc

2 CONC  John George Brosius and wife Catharine convey their tract of 205 acre
2 CONC s to (son) Sebastian Brosius, consideration 150 pounds. (They confirm
2 CONC the deed 6 Aug 1764). This was considerable below the actual value, an
2 CONC d we can be sure there was a separate agreement to support George & Ca
2 CONC tharine for the balance of their lives, and for legacy payments to the
2 CONC  other children. George & Catherine are probably deceased, intestate,
2 CONC by 1773 when Sebastian Brosius family moved to Northumberland Co., and
2 CONC  certainly deceased by 17 Apr 1774, when the homestead was conveyed by
2 CONC  Sebastin & wife, Margaretha (Roth) to Thomas Kurr, consideration 720

2 CONT : Note <span id='N34'>N34</span>JOHANN CASPER HEPLER
2 CONT : 1713 - 1769
2 CONT :
2 CONT : leaf rule
2 CONT :
2 CONC : The history of the Hepler-Heppler-Hoeppler-Hepler-Heabler family in
2 CONC America begins in 1748, when Casper Hoeppler, his wife Susanna and two
2 CONC  small sons landed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. From 1682 to 1776 th
2 CONC e province of Pennsylvania was the objective point of emigration from
2 CONC Germany, France and Switzerland. As early as 1727 the Provincial Counc
2 CONC il of Pennsylvania passed a resolution that the masters of the vessels
2 CONC  importing Germans and others from Europe shall be examined whether th
2 CONC ey have permission to carry these people; that a list be taken of the
2 CONC emigrants, the place from which they came, their occupation and their
2 CONC reason for coming to America. Our immigrant Johann Casper Hepler was b
2 CONC orn July 10, 1713 and his wife Susanna Scheible December 18, 1718.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : A writing was drawn up which each emigrant must sign in his own hand
2 CONC writing declaring allegiance and subjection to the king of Great Brita
2 CONC in and fidelity to the Proprietary of the Province. These ship lists a
2 CONC re published in the "Colonial Records" and "Rupps Immigrants" and the
2 CONC originals are preserved in the Library at Harrisburg.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : It was early in 1748 when the Hoepplers - Casper, Susanna and their
2 CONC first born Jacob,and baby Christopher set sail on the ship Patience (J
2 CONC ohn Browne, Master) from Rotterdam, Holland, for the New World. The pa
2 CONC ssenger list of this boat shows Casper Hepler (Hoeppler) was the seven
2 CONC teenth person to sign the usual forms at Philadelphia Court House, on
2 CONC September 16, 1748.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : Although documentation is lacking to connect the above immigrant wit
2 CONC h the early settler, the family historian relates that Upper Milford T
2 CONC ownship in Northampton County was his destination. This is approximate
2 CONC ly 30 miles north of Philadelphia, in the southern part of present day
2 CONC  Lehigh County, ten miles south of Allentown. The area is described:
2 CONT :
2 CONC : The soils of the Milfords is very productive and is well cultivated,
2 CONC  which is the chief employment of the inhabitants. The Milfords are we
2 CONC ll-watered with the best and most wholesome water found in the Lehigh
2 CONC County or any county in Pennsylvania. The surface formation is very ir
2 CONC regular, mountainous and hilly. In the southern part of Lower Milford
2 CONC is the Hosensack Hill or the great Mill Hill, commonly called "der Cro
2 CONC sse Muehlberg". Although there are many acres of land untillable in th
2 CONC e Milfords, these hills furnish fuel and timber... and are a great pro
2 CONC tection from destructive storms.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : The decision to settle here was unlikely based on proximity to marke
2 CONC t, since Philadelphia was a two-day wagon journey away. Availability o
2 CONC f land was an important factor; since this was still frontier, propert
2 CONC y was obtainable, and 115 acres was claimed. The German language predo
2 CONC minance and the Lutheran religion established would be additional cond
2 CONC itons favoring settlement in then Northampton County, an area of large
2 CONC ly German inhabitants, thus lessening the cultural shock.
2 CONT :
2 CONT : Church3 small
2 CONC : Dillingersville Union School & Church. Casper and his family were me
2 CONC mbers of this church. It was built as a church & school.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : As in many early communities, the local church was a significant bin
2 CONC ding element, and it is from the records of the Evangelical Lutheran C
2 CONC ongregation of Upper Milford (near Dillingersville) that the progress
2 CONC of the Hepler family is traced. The church was started about 1744. The
2 CONC  church was abandoned about 1791. Member from this church formed the n
2 CONC ucleus of the Lutheran Church at Zionsville.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : In 1757 a new congregation was organized at the Second Upper Milford
2 CONC  Lutheran Congregation. This is the church at Old Zionsville and the p
2 CONC resent church is a stately old edifice with a beautifully kept cemeter
2 CONC y. While Casper is not mentioned as one of the organizers, we find tha
2 CONC t he and his sons, Jacob and Christopher were communicants in 1765. Th
2 CONC e Reformed Church was also built in 1757. The church record book start
2 CONC ed at this time. The early history of the churches at Zionsville is so
2 CONC mewhat confusing, but apparently there were separate Lutheran & Reform
2 CONC ed church buildings from the beginning,said to have been log structure
2 CONC s until 1818. At that time the building had become old & unsatisfactor
2 CONC y & the Lutheran congregation decided to erect a new church. A number
2 CONC of the Reformed families then left the Reformed congregation & joined
2 CONC the Lutherans in erecting a Union Church. The arrangement continued un
2 CONC til 1871 at which time the Reformed members sold their interest inthe
2 CONC building & rejoined the original Reformed Church.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : The genealogist in looking up baptisms at Zionsville must therefore
2 CONC remember 4 places to examine records. Dillingersville and Zionsville L
2 CONC utheran Church records, Reformed that separated itself & the original
2 CONC Reformed record itself.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : The church records document at communion services, and the 1754, 175
2 CONC 5, 1766, and 1757 rosters show Casper and Susanna Hepler (spelled Hopf
2 CONC eler, Hepper, Heppeler or Hoebler) present. One newborn son is mention
2 CONC ed---Michael Hepler (spelled Hoppler), born January 2, 1757 and baptiz
2 CONC ed March 6, 1757, sponsored by Michael Scheibele and wife Barbara. Alt
2 CONC hough Casper Hepler's name is listed in 1758 and 1760, the name of Sus
2 CONC anna Hepler is no longer found after 1757 and it is presumed she died
2 CONC about this time.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : This era of six years peace and plenty was rudely broken when in 175
2 CONC 5 General Braddock was defeated by the French and Indians in Western P
2 CONC ennsylvania. The red man was immediately appeared in small groups in d
2 CONC ifferent sections of the settlements and began a murderous warfare aga
2 CONC inst the unsuspecting settlers. A report in 12-11-1755 states that 200
2 CONC  hostile Indians were roaming about the plantations killing settlers,
2 CONC and burning down their houses. Such were the trials, tribulations and
2 CONC dangers the first families of settlers experienced in the new land, an
2 CONC d in the midst of them was Casper Hepler with his growing family, now
2 CONC consisting of his wife and four children, Jacob, Christopher, Casper a
2 CONC nd George.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : In 1758 Susanna Hepler no longer appears. Se probably died about thi
2 CONC s time and Casper re-married about 1762 to Anna Mary who survived him,
2 CONC  and is mentioned in his will.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : The hardships of twenty years pioneer life told on Casper Hepler and
2 CONC  on April 29, 1769, he made his last will and testament. When he died
2 CONC is not known but the will was probated August 1, 1769, at Easton, Pa.
2 CONC He was only fifty-seven years old. His estate was left to his wife Ann
2 CONC a Mary as long as she remained his widow: at her death to his sons; Ja
2 CONC cob, two fifths, Christopher, Casper Jr. and George, each one-fifth. H
2 CONC e also willed to the overseers of the Lutheran Church of Upper Milford
2 CONC , presumably the church at Zionsville- twenty shillings, which gives u
2 CONC s a good idea of his character and integrity. Twenty shillings seems a
2 CONC  small sum now, but then 300 acres of land could be bought for that su
2 CONC m. His burial place, though urgently sought, has never been found but
2 CONC it is most likely at Zionsville. All the old stones have been removed
2 CONC as they were illegible.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : Casper Hepler was a weaver of cloth and worked at his trade. His far
2 CONC m which he acquired in 1753 was farmed by Michael Scheible, probably h
2 CONC is brother-in-law. Anna Mary died about 1771. for it was then that the
2 CONC  Venue of personal property was held and final account filed.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : Jacob the oldest son sold his two-fifth portion of the home farm to
2 CONC his brother Christopher, who in turn sold his share and the two shares
2 CONC  he bought from brother Jacob to Casper. Jacob bought land in Luzerne
2 CONC County. Later Jacob relocated to Armstrong County, Pa. The youngest br
2 CONC other George sold his one-fifth to Casper and established a home in Wh
2 CONC itehall Township. Christopher settled in North Carolina.
2 CONT :
2 CONT : THE WAR OF THE REVOLUTION
2 CONT :
2 CONC : In 1775 Old Man Mars again looms up in the shape of Great Britain in
2 CONC  its last and final efforts to subdue the spirits of the colonists. At
2 CONC  once the four sons of Casper: Jacob, Christopher, Casper Jr. & George
2 CONC  left their families of very young children to fight for their freedom
2 CONC  against the British.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : Jacob at once joined the regiment under Colonel Seigfried at Bethleh
2 CONC em, Pa. This outfit was part of General Israel Putman's Brigade, the m
2 CONC an who made famous the saying "Don't shoot till you see the whites of
2 CONC their eyes". Casper joined Colonel Kooken's Company, Second Battalion,
2 CONC  Northampton County, Pa. and George Hepler in the Sixth Battalion,unde
2 CONC r Captain Jacob Peterman.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : Again in the Militia Rolls of 1785 appear the names of Casper Hepler
2 CONC , Jacob Hepler and Stoffel Hepler.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : Following the war Jacob sold his two-fifth portion to his brother Ch
2 CONC ristopher, and bought land in Luzerne County. He lived there for somet
2 CONC ime, later moving and buying a farm in Armstrong County, Pa. There are
2 CONC  thousands of Heplers living there today.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : In 1785 Christopher sold out his portion of the farm to Casper Jr. C
2 CONC hristopher took his young family and moved to North Carolina and settl
2 CONC ed in what was then Rowan County, now Davies. They traveled in large C
2 CONC onestoga wagons.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : Casper Jr. bought his brother Christopher's portion of the farm in 1
2 CONC 785. He, his wife Anna Maria and their children lived there. December
2 CONC 9, 1795 he sold his farm to Balthaser Shultz. Casper set out in a nort
2 CONC h westerly direction to Mahantongo Township, Berks County, now Eldred
2 CONC Township, Schuylkill County, Pa.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : DAR records claim that George died in the war. His family at that ti
2 CONC me was living in Whitehall Township, then Northampton County, now Lehi
2 CONC gh County, Pa.
2 CONT :
2 CONT : Johann Caspar Hepler b. 10- Jul 1713 d. 1769
2 CONT : Susanna Scheible b. 18- Dec 1718 d. 1857
2 CONT :
2 CONT : Children
2 CONT : Jacob Hepler 	b. 29- Jun 1744 	d. 1808
2 CONT : Christopher Hepler 	b. 16- Jul 1746 	d. 1816
2 CONT : Casper Hepler 	b. 20- May 1751 	d. 27- Dec 1831
2 CONT : George Hepler 	b. 1755 	d. ca. 1783
2 CONT : Michael Hepler 	b. 2- Jan 1757 	d. ?
2 CONT :
2 CONC : The Heplers were a very religious family and after the long trip to
2 CONC America aboard the ship Patience, and the long trip from Philadelphia
2 CONC to Northampton County, I'm sure they prayed to God to give thanks for
2 CONC their safe journey. The hymn that is playing, "God himself is with us"
2 CONC  probably reflects their feelings upon arriving in America.

2 CONT : Note <span id='N33'>N33</span>Birth: Jun. 29, 1744
2 CONT : Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany Death: 1809
2 CONT : Pennsylvania, USA
2 CONC : He was born George Jacob. He was the son of Johann Casper and Susann
2 CONC ah Schneible of Northampton County Pennsylvania. He immigrated in 1748
2 CONC  with his parents on the ship "Patience" which set harbor in Philadelp
2 CONC hia. His father was the seventeenth person to sign the usual forms at
2 CONC Philadelphia Court House on September 16 1748. He married Elisabethe a
2 CONC nd was the father of Jacob Hepler and grandfather of William Hepler .
2 CONC George Jacob Hepler signed Oath of Allegiance in Northampton County Pe
2 CONC nnsylvania on January 23rd 1778. He signed his name as Jacob.
2 CONT : He fought in the Revolution along with his brothers.
2 CONC : Jacob at once joined the regiment under Colonel Seigfried at Bethleh
2 CONC em, Pa. This outfit was part of General Israel Putman's Brigade, the m
2 CONC an who made famous the saying "Don't shoot till you see the whites of
2 CONC their eyes." Casper joined Colonel Kooken's Company, Second Battalion,
2 CONC  Northampton County, Pa. and George Hepler in the Sixth Battalion, und
2 CONC er Captain Jacob Peterman.
2 CONC : Again in the Militia Rolls of 1785 appear the names of Casper Hepler
2 CONC , Jacob Hepler and Stoffel Hepler.
2 CONC : Jacob Hepler with his large family and many of his neighbors left No
2 CONC rthampton Co. in 1785. They settled for a short time in Luzerne Co, Ne
2 CONC scopeck Twp. Among taxables in 1790 were names like Henry, Casper, Joh
2 CONC n and Adam, familar names in Western Pennsylvania, also Jacob,& Henry
2 CONC Hepler, a little later Henry & George Daubenspeck. This confirms the t
2 CONC radition of descendants of Christian Hepler that the Hepler's came to
2 CONC Luzerne Co. A part of Jacob Hepler's large family was recorded in this
2 CONC  county in the 1790 census. There were two boys over 16 years old, Chr
2 CONC istian age 20 & Daniel age 18 years, five under 16 and one girl.
2 CONT :
2 CONC : Jacob had evidently traveled ahead to Allegheny Co., bringing with h
2 CONC im 2 boys under 16 and 4 girls, making a family of 7 boys and 5 girls.
2 CONC  In 1792 Jacob helped in the defense of the frontier against the India
2 CONC ns. In 1796,he began improvement on his tract of land in Buffalo Twp.,
2 CONC  northeast of the Allegheny river, on April 7, 1797 He began his impro
2 CONC vement in July of 1796. He had the land surveyed in 1802, found that J
2 CONC ames McCoy had a warrent for the same land dated February 23 1794. Do
2 CONC not know how the affair was settled, but Jacob was living on this trac
2 CONC t or part of it at the time of his death.
2 CONC : Jacob Hepler lived on this land in Armstrong Co. He perhaps was perm
2 CONC itted to keep the part he had improved by 1802. In 1807 Frederick Shoo
2 CONC p had 416 acres of James McCoy's land surveyed and encountered the sam
2 CONC e opposition as Jacob Hepler, but through some arrangement Frederick S
2 CONC hoop sold this land to the Harmons, Lunberrys and Blains Inc., includi
2 CONC ng a portion of land occupied by Jacob Hepler. Buffalo Township became
2 CONC  a part of Sugar Creek Township later. Jacob & Elizabeth are buried in
2 CONC  the Wilson cemetery below White Oak Cemetery in now Butler County. A
2 CONC new tombstone was erected in 1941. A new Government tombstone thatwas
2 CONC also erected at that time, states that Jacob was a pvt. in the 4th Pa

2 CONT
2 CONC :They first went to Elizabethtown (now Brockville), where she remained
2 CONC  while her husband looked at land for their homestead.  William chose
2 CONC a spot north of the Rideau River, close to where a fellow Loyalist had
2 CONC  settled, in Montague Township.  He and his neighbour (some sources sa
2 CONC y cousin, others a partner) began to build a mill at a location on the
2 CONC  river known today as Merrickville.
2 CONT
2 CONC :Sylvia (Comstock) Merrick joined her husband on the banks of the Ride
2 CONC au River in 1796, with their growing family.  They had three children
2 CONC at this time, but would eventually have a family of seven.

2 CONC :Her husband died in 1844.  Sylvia died in 1848.  They are buried toge

2 CONT ===Birth and Early Life===
2 CONT
2 CONC :Bork in born March 23, 1774, Her father died when she was young. (3)
2 CONC and upon the death of her father and her mother’s re-marriage she be
2 CONC came the step-daughter of Ephraim Eyres. During the Revolutionary Wars
2 CONC , Ephraim Eyres was a Loyalist spy and for his efforts in support of t
2 CONC he British he was captured and jailed in Albany NY. (1)
2 CONC : It appears during his imprisonment, his wife was allowed “go forwa
2 CONC rd” with some of her property and family perhaps as far as Lunenburg
2 CONC , Ontario (Stormont Township, near Cornwall). Following the peace sett
2 CONC lement in 1783, Ephraim escaped prison or was released and he headed n
2 CONC orth to Canada arriving to join his wife in 1784 at Stormont which at
2 CONC the time was a “staging area” for new United Empire Loyalists awai
2 CONC ting receipt of land claims and entitlements. (1)
2 CONT
2 CONC Meanwhile millwright William Merrick arrived in Canada at Sorel, Quebe
2 CONC c during the summer of 1788 (2) and traveled up the St. Lawrence from
2 CONC Sorel to Lunenburg where the same year he encountered and married Ephr
2 CONC aim’s daughter Sylvia Comstock. Perhaps with several of own children
2 CONC , Ephraim was anxious to get his step daughter off his hands for Sylvi
2 CONC a appears to have been only 14 or 15 years old at the time of her marr
2 CONC iage to 28 year old William !! (3) Merrick, who was a late arriving Lo
2 CONC yalist with no apparent record of service on behalf of the British in
2 CONC the American Revolution, had nothing but a basic property claim to loo
2 CONC k forward to, whereas Sylvia as the daughter of a British Revolutionar
2 CONC y war hero was entitled to petition for a substantial land entitlement
2 CONC .
2 CONT
2 CONC Ephraim Eyres himself was granted property in Elizabethtown (1) and Sy
2 CONC lvia and William followed to the burgeoning settlement which would bec
2 CONC ome Brockville. But millwright William Merrick was determined to find
2 CONC a sight for a new mill and as early as 1790 he began to explore the co
2 CONC untry north of the St. Lawrence with a partner Roger Stephens (also a
2 CONC 1776 war veteran with substantial land entitlements). Together they st
2 CONC ruck the Rideau from Irish Creek, traveled down river to the “Great
2 CONC Fall” a sight they chose for their first lumber mill and soon a gris
2 CONC t mill.

2 CONC Meanwhile back in Elizabethtown Sylvia was occupied with a new family<

2 CONC https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:V5MG-V5Q : 10 February 2018),
2 CONC William Merrick, 26 May 1793; citing SAINT ANDREW'S PRESBYTERIAN,WILLI
2 CONC AMSTOWN,GLENGARRY,ONTARIO; FHL microfilm 928,968.</ref> and by the tim
2 CONC e she joined Merrick at his new mill probably about 1796, she had give
2 CONC n birth to three children, Charlotte, 1791, William Jr. 1793 and Charl
2 CONC es, 1796. She was now 23 years old. While she had probably often trave
2 CONC led to her husband’s Merrick’s Mills it appears she continued to l
2 CONC ive in Elizabethtown, at least during the winters.(2).
2 CONT
2 CONC William Merrick died in 1844 and Sylvia followed a few years later (18
2 CONC 48). They are both buried, together with their eldest child, Charlotte
2 CONC , and her husband, in Merrickville in the old cemetery at the foot of
2 CONC Collar Hill. They were interred under Welsh style stone crypt and grav
2 CONC e markers.
2 CONT
2 CONC Sylvia Comstock Merrick must certainly have been a remarkable woman. A
2 CONC side from raising seven children, she was apparently of strong support
2 CONC  to William, who was a dominant, strong-willed, determined and at time
2 CONC s difficult individual. He was also opportunistic, generally allying h
2 CONC imself with others who were in position to receive greater land grants
2 CONC  and allocations than he was; all traits that made him successful as a
2 CONC  pioneer and developer of Merrickville. But he probably was not the mo
2 CONC st gentle of men to live with.
2 CONT
2 CONC Sylvia and William Merrick had 7 children who survived to adulthood, a
2 CONC nd who as a family continued to build mills and develop the successful
2 CONC  Village which became Merrickville.

2 CONT == Biography ==
2 CONC Thomas Merrick was likely born in Wales. His birthplace has been given
2 CONC  as St. David's in Pembrokeshire. His birth year unclear - some source
2 CONC s say 1608 and others say 1620. 1620 is unlikely, because men had to b
2 CONC e at least 21 to gain status as freemen, and most attained that status
2 CONC  between about 25 and 30. Thomas could not have received land until he
2 CONC  was a freeman. Since Thomas had married and received land by 1639, he
2 CONC  had to have been born by 1618. He was also one of six men ordered to
2 CONC participate in a diplomatic mission to the Warranocke Indians "to know
2 CONC  the reasons why they said they are afraid of us" in April 1638.<ref>G
2 CONC reat Migration: Immigrants to New England, 1634-1635, Volume VI, R-S,

2 CONC  to Eastham, one to Newbury, and one remaining in Charlestown. Thomas
2 CONC Merrick is noted as having been in Roxbury in 1636... He was in Agawam

2 CONC :: `William Merrick, the oldest of the four brothers who reached Charl
2 CONC estown in the good ship 'James' in the spring of 1636, was born in Wal
2 CONC es in 1603. Of his early life nothing is known. He was a farmer by occ
2 CONC upation after reaching the colony; what trade or avocation he had foll
2 CONC owed in Wales is not known. That his instincts and tastes inclined him
2 CONC  toward a military life appear in the fact that he served for six year
2 CONC s, after his arrival in the colony, in the colonial militia under Capt
2 CONC ain Miles Standish. He was spoken of first as an Ensign, and later as
2 CONC a Lieutenant. That he gave all his time and attention to his military
2 CONC dueits seems to be indicated by the fact that he was not married until
2 CONC  1642, which was at the end of his six years' term of service. He appe
2 CONC ars to have had property both at Eastham and Duxbury. He was probably
2 CONC married at Eastham, but the destruction of a part of the first book of
2 CONC  records of that town renders it impossible to determine this fact def
2 CONC initely. He certainly lived in both Eastham and Duxbury, within the de
2 CONC cade from 1637 to 1647, as some of his children were born at Eastham d
2 CONC uring that time, and yet he is reported as being a citizen of Duxtury.
2 CONC  The records relate that he was a citizen of Duxbury in 1636; was allo
2 CONC tted 5 Acres of land 'next the Glade at Powder Point;' in 1637 he was
2 CONC allotted another 20 acres at Great Head; he was one of the original pr
2 CONC oprietors of Bridgewater. He was Surveyor of Highways in 1646, and Con
2 CONC stable in 1647. He married at Eastham in 1642, Rebecca, whose surname
2 CONC is not known. He became a legal voter in Eastham May 22, 1655, which i
2 CONC s the time when he took up his permanent residence in that town, his o
2 CONC ther visits having probably been with his wife's family. He had ten ch
2 CONC ildren born to him by Rebecca, who died in 1668 at Eastham. `Paige, in
2 CONC  his history of Hardwick, dwells upon the fact that he was so old as t
2 CONC o seem rather the grandfather than the father of his own family. He sa
2 CONC ys: 'William Merrick, the father, was a Lieutenant, residing in Eastha
2 CONC m. In his will, dated December 3, 1686, and proved March 6, 1688/9, he
2 CONC  is described as 'about 86 years of age,' by which it would seem that
2 CONC he was about 43 years old when the first of his 10 children was born,
2 CONC and he might seem to be the grandfather of this family rather than the
2 CONC  father, were it not that he names his wife, Rebecca and his children,
2 CONC  Stephen and William, in his will.' '<ref>[[#S407|Merrick]]: pages not

2 CONC ::: "He was in Plymouth by Oct. 1636, when he received a grant of land
2 CONC  there and answered an action in court [Plymouth Colony records, 1:44-

2 CONC dence of this is afforded by several records which show that the Colon
2 CONC y arranged, between 1661 and 1666 for the purchase of land at Saconett
2 CONC  [later Little Compton, R.I.] to accommodate the claim of former serva

2 CONC is placed his residence in the bounds of Duxbury, which became a separ

2 CONC :: Note: 'William Merrick was an early resident of Eastham. He came ov
2 CONC er to this country before 1636; settled first within the limits of Old
2 CONC  Duxbury, and had land granted him by the Colonial court near the path
2 CONC  to 'Green Harbor' in 1637; also land granted him adjoining Mr. Willia
2 CONC m Collier's, in 1630. In 1643, he was a juror for Duxbury, and in 1646
2 CONC  was a surveyor of highways. In 1648, he was on the jury that tried Mr
2 CONC s. Alice Bishop for the murder of her little daughter at Plymouth....I
2 CONC n 1652, he was admitted a freeman, and not long after moved to Eastham
2 CONC . He was among the settlers there May 2, 1655, as appears by the ancie
2 CONC nt records of that township. He settled within the limits of the prese
2 CONC nt town of Orleans, in that part called Skaket. Among his neighbors we
2 CONC re Richard Knowles, John Freeman and Robert Wixon. The date of the ear
2 CONC liest entry respecting granting of land to him at Eastham is not clear
2 CONC . In 1659, the records show that he had a lot granted him of about 4 a
2 CONC cres adjoining 'Robard Wixon,' denominated a 'house lott' by the highw
2 CONC ay, with the small piece of meadow within his fence, showing he had im
2 CONC proved the lot previous to the grant; also this year a tract of upland
2 CONC  at Pocke, near 'Robard Wixon's' tract, containing a bout 15 acres, wa
2 CONC s granted him; also meadow at 'Little Namskaket,' 'Rock Harbor,' and a
2 CONC t 'Boat Meadow;' together with another tract of 8 acres, as 'his great
2 CONC  lot,' on the south side of the 'Cove.' In 1662, he was, with 'other a
2 CONC ncient freemen and old servants,' chosen to look out for land for his
2 CONC accommodation, provided Saconet Neck was not purchased, in another loc
2 CONC ality. In 1666, he was allowed to purchase land. Mr. Merrick was appoi
2 CONC nted in 1663 Lieutenant of the trained band at Eastham, an office whic
2 CONC h had long been held by Lieut. Joseph Rogers. He was succeeded by Lieu
2 CONC t. Rogers in 1664. Mr. Merrick at this date was beyond the age of 60,
2 CONC and was thereby disqualified by law to do military duty. He had been e
2 CONC nsign of the trained band for some time. He is mentioned in the record
2 CONC s as 'Ensign Merrick.' He held no other important office while a resid
2 CONC ent of Eastham. He was a surveyor in 1665, and receiver of excise in 1
2 CONC 668. 'The date of his marriage does not occur in the Plymouth Colony r
2 CONC ecords or the ancient records of Eatham. He undoubtedly was married in
2 CONC  this country some few years after his arrival. His wife at the time o
2 CONC f his death was Rebecca, but whether she was the mother of all of his
2 CONC children, the writer is not informed. He died at Eastham the last of t
2 CONC he year 1688, or the beginning of 1689, as his will was presented for
2 CONC probate at Barnstable in March, 1689. He was about 86 years old when h
2 CONC e made his will, the year previous. Mr. Merrick, as far as is known, h
2 CONC ad 10 children: 6 sons and 4 daughters.'<ref>[[#S129|Smith]]: No. 32,
2 CONC pp. 12-14</ref>
2 CONC :: Note: William Merrick, born about 1600-3, perhaps in Wales, is said
2 CONC  to have ocme to New England with the usual "three brothers" in the "J
2 CONC ames" in the spring of 1636. While proof of this statement has not bee
2 CONC n found, he was certainly here before October of that year, at which t
2 CONC ime he received a grant of land in Plymouth and answered an action in
2 CONC Court there. Comment has been occasioned by the fact that he did not m
2 CONC arry until 1642, after which date he had ten children, to whom his age
2 CONC  made him sem more like a grandfather than a father and there has been
2 CONC  voiced a suggestion that he may have been bound for six years of mili
2 CONC tary service and not free to marry until it was completed, but no law
2 CONC or ruling justifying such a theory has been seen. It seems much more p
2 CONC robable that he came as a servant to some more prosperous colonist and
2 CONC  was bound, therefore, to work for a term of years in return for the c
2 CONC ost of his voyage, in which case he would have to wipe out this debt b
2 CONC y "working out his freedom" before he would be able t omarry. Stong co
2 CONC lor is given to this theory, as well as evidence of the patience somet
2 CONC imes required before promises of grants of land were finally fulfilled
2 CONC , by certain interlocking facts shown in a series of actions by the Pl
2 CONC ymouth Court, as (a), on June 4, 16651, when "Libertie is granted unto
2 CONC  some whoe were formerly servants whoe have land due unto them by cove
2 CONC nant, to nominate some psons to the Court or to some of the majestrate
2 CONC s, to be deputed in their behalfe to purchase a pcell of land for thei
2 CONC re accomodations att Saconett" [then in Massachusetts but later Little
2 CONC  Compton, Rhode Island]; (b), on June 3, 1662, when Captain Willett wa
2 CONC s appointed "to purchase the land of the Indians which is graunted unt
2 CONC o such that were servants and others that were ancient freemen ... tha
2 CONC t the abovesaid servants and ancient freemen shall have liberty, in ca
2 CONC se they cannot procure Saconett Necke according to the graunt, to look
2 CONC e out some other place, undisposed of, for theire accomodation. Theire
2 CONC  names are as followeth: ... William Merrick ..., (c), on June 7, 1665
2 CONC , when discussion occurred "conserning the land att Saconett, in refer
2 CONC ence unto the petitioners for it called ancient servants ..., (d), on
2 CONC June 5, 1666, when "the ancient servants ... shall either bee accomoda
2 CONC ted att Saconett, according to a former graunt, or on the south-side o
2 CONC f Weymouth ... [see map on p. 373] and in case they have it att the la
2 CONC tter place, thet they shall have fifty acrees apeece ... betwixt this
2 CONC date and November next;" (e), on October 31, 1661, when William Merric
2 CONC k and another who had apparently been tentatively assigned to the Weym
2 CONC outh vicinity, "incase they be not accomodated with land amongst them
2 CONC with whom they are listed neare the Bay line that they may looke out f
2 CONC or accomodation elswher; or incase that Saconett can be purchased of t
2 CONC he Indians, that then the said pties may have there portions of land t
2 CONC here, if they please; and finally, (f), on July 4, 1673, when bounds w
2 CONC ere named at Saconett for the grant to the "old servants," a committee
2 CONC  was appointed to locate thes elimits and a requirement was made that
2 CONC the "old servants ... shall make theire appeearance att Plymouth ont h
2 CONC e twenty second of this psent July, then and theire to make out theire
2 CONC  right, and also pay such dispursements as shall nessesarily be requir
2 CONC ed, or otherwise loose theire right."
2 CONT :::
2 CONC ::: Twenty-nine men, including William Merrick, comlied with this orde
2 CONC r on this date and thus became the original proprietors of what is now
2 CONC  Little Compton, Rhode Island, although at this time no one had settle
2 CONC d there, but few did for some years to come and it is quite certain th
2 CONC at neighte William nor his immediate family ever did so. He owned lot
2 CONC number twelve and until 1681 or perhaps 1687 the proprietors' meetings
2 CONC  were held at Duxbury because the majority of them still lived in that
2 CONC  vicinity.
2 CONT :::
2 CONC ::: A group of conflicting statements which are hard to harmonize and
2 CONC yet, fromtheir source, quite as hard to contradict, relate to the dela
2 CONC yed acquisition of freemanship by "William Merrick" of which name ther
2 CONC e is no other adult than our William seen at that period. His name was
2 CONC  included in a list of those "Ppounded to take up theire Freedom" [see
2 CONC  Appendix, p. 853] on June 5, 1651; was still so listed on June 3, 165
2 CONC 2, yet he was not admitted and sworn a freeman until June 1, 1658, alt
2 CONC hough in the meanwhile he was counted among the legal voters of Eastha
2 CONC m on May 22, 1655, and had taken the oath of fidelity at Duxbury in 16
2 CONC 57. Since he had so lately become a freeman, the term "ancient freeman
2 CONC " [see (b)] could hardly have pertained to him, in reference to the pe
2 CONC rsonnel of the grantees of Saconett, and the logical deduction then is
2 CONC  that he was one of the "old servants," meaning one who came over earl
2 CONC y. Nor need the term "servant" cause any great uneasiness in the minds
2 CONC  of those who carry descent from such a one,for in those days any man
2 CONC of means who came to New England brought with him a group of young men
2 CONC  or young women, or both, to aid in claring the land and in providing
2 CONC and keeping a home, and these were often young relatives or neighbors'
2 CONC  children and frequently of the same or similar social standing as the
2 CONC ir employer.
2 CONT :::
2 CONC ::: While seeming discrepancy of statement is found as to the place of
2 CONC  residence of William, the matter is clarified by recognition of the f
2 CONC act that while he first appeared as a resident of Plymouth, received f
2 CONC rom that town a grant of five acres "next to the glade on Powder Point
2 CONC " in October, 1636, and another of twenty acres on "Greenes Harbor Pay
2 CONC th" in October, 1637 [see map on p. 685], this placed him without remo
2 CONC val on his part, in what became Duxbury in the latter year. In 1646 he
2 CONC  was using two acres of meadow rented for two years from Abraham Pears
2 CONC e of Duxbury; on July 26, 1649, he and John Vobes paid four pounds ste
2 CONC rling to George Partridge for five acres at "poulder point" and on tha
2 CONC t date he, called Sergeant, having "formerly been in partnership with
2 CONC John Vobes abovesaid in a house and parcel of upland Containing about
2 CONC fifteene acars bee it more or les," sold his portion to Vobes for L12
2 CONC sterling. As an inhabitant of Duxbury he automatically became a propri
2 CONC etor in 1645 in an extended grant made to that town, which by later su
2 CONC bdivision became Bridgewater, but no evidence is found of his removal
2 CONC thereto.
2 CONT :::
2 CONC ::: On October 5, 1636, William Bradford entered action of trespass ag
2 CONC ainst William Merrick and three others, asking L10 damages and receivi
2 CONC ng a verdict of L5 and costs. William started action against John Atwo
2 CONC od for whom he had worked and together they agreed to submit their dif
2 CONC ferences to arbitration with the result that Atwood was ordered to pay
2 CONC  him L5 in full for "moweing, makeing and stacking his hey this yeare
2 CONC at Greenes Harbour Marsh, save that the said Mr Atwood is to pay those
2 CONC  that helped him to loade it into the leighter what their wages shall
2 CONC come too."
2 CONT :::
2 CONC ::: The public service of William Merrick was not notable but it was s
2 CONC ufficient to show that he had the confidence ofhis townsmen for he ser
2 CONC ved on petit juries in 1643-5, 1648-9, 1652 and 1658; on grand juries
2 CONC in 1644, 1658 and 1684; as a surveyor of highways at Duxbury in 1646;
2 CONC probably as a constable there in 1647 and as a receiver of excise in E
2 CONC astham in 1668. He and John Doane took an inventory of the estate of N
2 CONC athaniel Mayo in 1661 and he and John Freeman witnessed the will of Jo
2 CONC siah Cooke, Sr., and testified to it in Court in 1673. Probably his gr
2 CONC eatest public service was rendered in a military way for he was a priv
2 CONC ate under Captain Standish in and probably before 1643, a sergeant in
2 CONC 1649, an ensign for a considerable period before 1663 and, as such, he
2 CONC  was raised to the rank of lieutenant of the Eastham military company
2 CONC in that year, though replaced the following year because of age disqua
2 CONC lification.
2 CONT :::
2 CONC ::: The date of removal of William and his family to Eastham has not b
2 CONC een proved. The registration of the births of his entire family at Eas
2 CONC tham would ordinarily suggest that as the native town of even the elde
2 CONC st, but his public service in Duxbury in 1646 and probably in 1647 mak
2 CONC es it seem more probable that one or two of his children were born at
2 CONC the latter place. The identity of his wife Rebecca, whom he married ab
2 CONC out 1642, has long been unknown but late developments show her, beyond
2 CONC  reasonable doubt, to have been the daughter of Stephen Tracy [see Tra
2 CONC cy, p. 801].
2 CONT :::
2 CONC ::: His will, dated December 3, 1688, and changed to 1686, gave his ag
2 CONC e as about eighty-six, made his wife Rebecca executrix and left his es
2 CONC tate for her use during her life. It also provided that what was "left
2 CONC  at my wife's decease my will is that it be equally divided amongst al
2 CONC lmy children my Grand child Ruth Freeman to have an equal share amongs
2 CONC t the Rest of my children." There has been an uncertainty felt in osme
2 CONC  quarters as to the parentage of this Ruth Freeman but this document s
2 CONC hows her mother to have been a deceased daughter of William Merrick, s
2 CONC ince Ruth herself received what wouldhave been her mother's share of t
2 CONC he estate. Of his daughters, Sarah had married John Freeman (John, Edm
2 CONC ond) but she had no child named Ruth and moreover she was still liing
2 CONC at the date of his will; no evidene is found of the marriage or even s
2 CONC urvival to maturity of Rebecca; Mary had married Stephen3 Hopkins, lea
2 CONC ving only the daughter Ruth, who is positively stated by some, and bel
2 CONC ieved by others, to have been the first wife of Edmond Freeman and the
2 CONC  mother of this child Ruth Freeman. The record of this marriage has no
2 CONC t been found nor that of the death of Ruth Merrick, but thegranddaught
2 CONC er Ruth Freeman is found in the family of Edomd3 Freeman (John2, Edmon
2 CONC d1) and is the only person of that name in that generation. She is som
2 CONC etimes erroneously assigned to the second wife of Edmone3 but exhausti
2 CONC ve study of these families justifies but the one conclusion as to the
2 CONC marriage of, birth of an only daughter to, and early death of Ruth (Me
2 CONC rrick) Freeman.

2 CONT
2 CONC Merrick in his genealogy makes the Rev. John of St. David's the father
2 CONC  of the four Myricks who came to New England, however, no proof is giv
2 CONC en and he admits that: "This is pure assumption, as no record of John'
2 CONC s children has as yet been found... this writer bequeaths this, with m
2 CONC any other unsolved riddles, to the successor whom he hopes and believe
2 CONC s will some time revise, correct, and enlarge the present work".(<b>3<
2 CONC /b>)
2 CONT
2 CONC Tradition states that James and his younger brother John (b.c.1614) ca
2 CONC me from St. David's, Pembrokeshire and that they arrived in America in
2 CONC  1636 on the "James" but, they are not listed on the shipping lists an
2 CONC d no authority is given for this statement.
2 CONT
2 CONC James and John were early inhabitants of Charlestown, MA where John wa
2 CONC s granted a house lot in 1644. The grant to James has not been found b
2 CONC ut, he owned land there before 1649 since it is mentioned as a bound i
2 CONC n that year. In 1655/6 the bounds of his and John's lands were finally
2 CONC  settled.
2 CONT
2 CONC James was a cooper and fish-monger owning a wharf in Charlestown. John
2 CONC  was also a cooper and he attached the wharf of Henry Kemble because H
2 CONC enry had taken a son of his and withheld a writing (John had apprentic
2 CONC ed his son to Henry). James testified about 1653, aged forty years, th
2 CONC at John Smith took mackerel at the house of Edward Johnson and on 22 M
2 CONC ay 1653 he again testified in court aged 40 years.
2 CONT
2 CONC Before 1657 James moved to Newbury where he remained for some years an
2 CONC d where most of his children were born. On 13 May 1657 John Andrews of
2 CONC  Charlestown purchased land there from "James Mirack, Cooper and Marge
2 CONC rite his wife."
2 CONT
2 CONC After the birth of his last child in 1670 James moved to Boston but, r
2 CONC eturned to Newbury before 1681. Later his son James Jr. went to Boston
2 CONC  to live. On 25 Oct. 1676 James Sr. of Boston sold to James Jr. his ho
2 CONC use lot in Newbury with all of the household goods for £40. James Jr.
2 CONC  was also to receive from his brother the last year's rent of 40/. Jam
2 CONC es Jr. of Newbury then sold the house to William Ellsby of Newbury for
2 CONC  £40 15 June 1679.

2 CONC John Dumbleton was killed by Indians during King Philip's War. Soon af

2 CONC :  opened a door unto yt desolating war, began by Philip Sachem of ye
2 CONC Pakaneket Indians, by which this handful was sorely pressed yet sovere
2 CONC ignly preserved. But yet not so as that we should be wholly exempted f
2 CONC rom the fury of war, for our soil was moistened by the blood of three
2 CONC Springfield men, young Goodman (John) Dumbleton, who came to our mill
2 CONC and two sons of Goodman Brooks, who came here to look after ye iron on
2 CONC  ye land he had lately bought of Mr. John Pynchon Esqr., who being per
2 CONC suaded by Springfield folk, went to accompany them, but (they) fell in
2 CONC  the way by the first assault ye enemy made upon us, at wch time they
2 CONC burn'd Mr. Cornish's house to ashes and also John Sacket's, with his b
2 CONC arn and what was in it, being ye first snowy day of winter (27 October
2 CONC ); they also at this time lodged a bullet in George Granger's leg, wch
2 CONC  was, the next morning taken out by Mr. Bulkly, and ye wound soon heal
2 CONC ed; It was judged that the enemy did receive some lose at this time, b
2 CONC ecause in ye ashes of Mr. Cornish's house were found pieces of ye boan
2 CONC es of a man, lying about ye length of a man in ye ashes. Also in winte
2 CONC r, some sculking Rascolds, upon a Lord's day, in ye time of or afterno
2 CONC on worship, fired Amb. Fowler's house and barn, and in ye week after,
2 CONC Walter Lee's barn; but in ye latter end and giving up of winter, ye la
2 CONC st snowy day we had thereof, we discovering an end of Indians, did sen
2 CONC d out to make a full discovery of the same, designing onely three or f
2 CONC our to go out, with order that they should not assalt them, but to or
2 CONC woe and smart, there going 10 or 12, not as scouts, but as assailants,
2 CONC  rid furiously upon ye enemy, from whom they received a furious charge
2 CONC , whereby Moses Cook, an inhabitant, and Clemence Bates, a soldier, lo

2 CONC pringfield on June 12, 1683; daughter of Thomas and Margaret (Hullings
2 CONC ) Bliss. Edward Foster testified that he came from "Barnett" in Englan
2 CONC d on September 9, 1650.
2 CONT #Priscilla died at Windsor, Connecticut on October 20, 1639.
2 CONT
2 CONC By May 15, 1637 the family was living at Windsor, Connecticut where he
2 CONC  had a land grant but sold part of it in 1642 to Thomas Newell probabl
2 CONC y because of serious financial problems.  On October 14, 1642 the cour
2 CONC t "took into custody all of Thomas Marshfield's estate, goods and chat
2 CONC tels to pay his debts," afterwhich he may have returned to England but
2 CONC  it is far likely that he died for his wife was herafter known as "Wid

2 CONC s.<ref name=TAG67 />Her husband had probably died shortly after his la
2 CONC st appearance in the records of  Windsor in 1642.<ref name=TAG63 />  A
2 CONC  grant for a homelot in Springfield has not been found, indicating she
2 CONC  may have moved to Springfield to join her married daugher whose husba
2 CONC nd had received a homelot grant.<ref name=TAG67 />

2 CONC At court in Springfield in 1649 she, Widow Marshfield, was accused of
2 CONC witchcraft by Goodwife Parsons wife of Hugh Parsons.  The accusation w
2 CONC as that that Widow Marshfield had caused one of the Parson's children
2 CONC and one cow to die.  It came out in testimony that this Widow Maarshfi
2 CONC eld was the same as wife of Thomas Marshfield who had previously lived
2 CONC  in Widsor, Connecticut.  At the time of these court proceedings, Wido
2 CONC w Marshfield had three children, one of which was married and had a ch
2 CONC ild. <ref name=TAG63 /><ref name=TAG67 />
2 CONT
2 CONC Widow Marshfield brought the accusation to court to protect her good n
2 CONC ame and on May 30, 1649 the court ruled in her favor.  Goodwife Parson
2 CONC s was order to pay L3 to the widow Marshfield or else be whipped twent
2 CONC y lashes.  She payed the fine rather than the whipping.<ref name=TAG67
2 CONC  />
2 CONT
2 CONC In a search for the name of widow Marshfield's son-in-law, the only ma
2 CONC n who seems likely to be him is  John Dumbleton, whose wife Mercy had
2 CONC not previously been identified.  Richardson in ''"Thomas Marshfield's
2 CONC Wife Mercy; Did Their Daughter Mercy Marry John Dumbleton?"'' found th
2 CONC ere were no other candidates except him who lived in the small town of
2 CONC  Springfield and fit the profile he was looking for;  all other men of
2 CONC  that age were already accounted for.  Since the Springfield vital rec
2 CONC ords show no record of the daughter's marriage nor the birth of their
2 CONC child, the timeline for the events seem to be:
2 CONC #The eldest daughter, named Mercy, married her husband while still in
2 CONC Windsor.
2 CONC #The couple had their first born child in Springfield before the move
2 CONC to Windsor.
2 CONC #They had their 2nd child named John, born at Springfield on January 2
2 CONC , 1650/1.<ref name=TAG67 />
2 CONT
2 CONC Naming of the additional children of John and Mercy (Marshfield) Dumbl
2 CONC eton is significant.  There was a 2nd daughter by the name of Mercy; t
2 CONC wo sons named Samuel after Mercy Dumbleton's brother; a third daughter
2 CONC  named Sarah (for Mercy Dumbleton's only sister Sarah (Marshfield).  S
2 CONC arah, Thomas and Mercy Marshfield's other daughter, as well as Samuel
2 CONC their son, used similar naming patterns.<ref name=TAG67 />
2 CONT
2 CONC The widow of Thomas Marshfield, Mercy Marshfield, died and was buried
2 CONC at Springfield on September 30, 1654.<ref name=TAG67 />Her given name
2 CONC appears in her death record according to the research of Douglas RICHA
2 CONC RDSON in his article at The American Genealogist.<ref name=TAG67 />

2 CONC Lydia (Axtell/Maynard) Moore was daughter of Thomas Axtell and his  wi
2 CONC fe, Mary (_____) Axtell, and the adopted daughter of John Maynard who
2 CONC married Mary at Sudbury 16 Jun 1646 (after Thomas died in March of tha
2 CONC t year).
2 CONT
2 CONC On 20 Jan 1668/9 John Maynard, husbandman, gave bond of 20 pounds for
2 CONC the appearance of "his daughter Lidiah" to answer to a charge of forni
2 CONC cation with Joseph Moore.
2 CONT
2 CONC On 26 Jan 1668/9, Joseph Moore confessed to fornication with Lydia May
2 CONC nard and gave bond of 20 pounds for his appearance to answer the charg
2 CONC e, with Jacob Moore (his brother) and Henry Rice as sureties.
2 CONT
2 CONC On 28 Jan 1668/9, Joseph Moore was summoned to answer for fornication
2 CONC with Lydia Maynard.
2 CONT
2 CONC Lydia married [[Moore-4393|Joseph Moore]] between 28 Jan 1668/9 (when
2 CONC still single, charged with fornication with each other, and she was no
2 CONC  doubt pregnant) and 14 Apr 1669 when their son Benoni was born (Sudbu
2 CONC ry vital records); she is most definitely married by 5 Oct 1669 by whi
2 CONC ch time the records refer to her as "Lydia Maynard now Moore".
2 CONT
2 CONC She died 23 NOV 1717 Sudbury, Middlesex, Massachusetts.<ref>Sudbury Vi
2 CONC tal Records, Deaths, p 317</ref>
2 CONT
2 CONC On 5 Oct 1669, petition by Elizabeth Moore, mother of Joseph, and Mary
2 CONC  Maynard, mother of Lydia Maynard now Moore, seeking that the impositi
2 CONC on of corporeal punishment for fornication on their children be reliev
2 CONC ed, and a fine imposed instead. The court minutes of the period are mi
2 CONC ssing, so we do not know when the charge was first made, what exactly
2 CONC the penalty was, or whether the petition of the mothers was respected.

2 CONC There is uncertainty about when John Moore arrived in New England. If

2 CONC :There was also a John Moore of Cambridge who owned land ''there'' as

2 CONC Many genealogical studies of John(1) Moore and his family claim that h

2 CONC  of Henry and Elizabeth (Frost) Rice of Stanstead, co. Suffolk, Englan

2 CONC Anderson discusses the discrepancy between ages given by Alice at vari
2 CONC ous depositions (calculating back to a 1602/3 birth) and her 1594 bapt
2 CONC ism, and concludes that "in her eighth decade Alice chose to present h
2 CONC erself as a younger woman, given that she was more than a decade older
2 CONC  than William Tilley."
2 CONT
2 CONC She married first 19 Nov 1612 in Stanstead, Suffolk, Thomas Blower, by
2 CONC  whom she had at least one son, John, baptized in Sudbury, Suffolk Feb
2 CONC  1627/8.<ref>Robert Charles Anderson, "Alice (Frost) (Blower) Tilley,"

2 CONC  and others make the case that she was also mother (by Blower) of Sara
2 CONC h who years later called [William] Tilley father, Tilley being too you
2 CONC ng to be Sarah's father, she must have been his step daughter.
2 CONT
2 CONC She married second, in Boston, Massachusetts, shortly after 6 July 164
2 CONC 0, William Tilley, ten years her junior.
2 CONT
2 CONC She was a prominent midwife, ran afoul of the authorities and was jail
2 CONC ed in 1648, resulting in a number of petitions for her support signed
2 CONC by dozens of Boston and Dorchester women.
2 CONT
2 CONC Her husband William Tilly hired Hugh Gullison [Gunnison?] to prosecute
2 CONC  William Philips and his wife for slandering his wife.
2 CONT
2 CONT Around this time William and Alice left Boston for Cape Porpus, Maine.
2 CONT
2 CONC There is evidence that late in their lives (1665), Alice may have left
2 CONC  William for lack of support.  William petitioned the court who ordere
2 CONC d that they return to living together as man and wife and that he supp
2 CONC ort her. Punishment for not doing so would be 40 pounds for him and im

2 CONC :'''Note:''' Despite the presence of such in many locations (including
2 CONC  here on WikiTree), the 1983 Edmund Rice (1638) Association publicatio
2 CONC n "Supplement 2 part 1" says there is no proof that a son Edmund ever
2 CONC existed. An April 1714 Middlesex Co probate [citation?] gave the illus
2 CONC ion of such a child, but subsequent research revealed this 1714 probat
2 CONC e action was for son EDWARD. Somehow this probate involved the estate
2 CONC of the old man Edmund Rice Senior because essentially every one one hi
2 CONC s offspring had a descendant represented in that probate (see the Ward
2 CONC  ca1857 Rice book, the very same book that created the false illusion
2 CONC of a son Edmund).
2 CONT
2 CONC The Edmund Rice (1638) Association estimates that after 13 or 14 gener
2 CONC ations, descendants of Edmund Rice may be in the many hundreds of thou

2 CONC "One of William's ancestors was apparently an Augustinian monk, Johann

2 CONC nastery to the English King when Henry VIII broke with the Catholic Ch
2 CONC urch. Johannes apparently changed his name to John Axtell and had a fa
2 CONC mily. Silas B. Axtell describes this connection in a 1952 speech he ga
2 CONC ve at a family reunion, The Axtell Heritage. He also speculates about
2 CONC a possible connection back to 1327. The speech says that the monk was
2 CONC William's father, but the dates are too spread out for that scenario t
2 CONC o be reasonable. Dean C. Axtell stopped in at the Family History Libra
2 CONC ry in Salt Lake City (1995). According to their files, William Axtell
2 CONC was born in 1587 and his father, John Axstyl, was born 1561. The monk
2 CONC signed the deed in 1534, so maybe the monk was William's great-grandfa

2 CONT ==Biography==
2 CONT
2 CONT ==NOTE Jan, 2015==
2 CONC John Maynard II, the first immigrant ancestor, settled in Sudbury (now
2 CONC  Wayland) and was one of the forty-seven who shared the meadow along t
2 CONC he Sudbury River. His house lot of four acres was near those of Edmond
2 CONC  and Henry Rice on North Street. At first, he built a low loghouse pro
2 CONC bably with a thatched roof and later a frame house. John was evidently
2 CONC  desirous to locate in a fertile spot where cattle could be fed and a
2 CONC home maintained. John was admitted a freeman on May 20,1644 and was se
2 CONC lect man of Sudbury in 1646.
2 CONT
2 CONC John II's first wife was Judith Starr. When she died in 1642, John lat
2 CONC er remarried her sister, Mary in 1645. In early records and histories,
2 CONC  there are several conflicting accounts of John Maynard. There are cla
2 CONC ims of two men of the same name in the area and one account of them be
2 CONC ing married to the same Mary Starr. Most account have the familes of J
2 CONC ohn II and John III confused. I believe that John of Sudbury can be pr
2 CONC oven and that the account of another event settles the John II/ John I
2 CONC II confusion. In 1660, the inhabitants of Sudbury petitioned the Gener
2 CONC al Court, stating that as the Lord had blessed them with very large fa
2 CONC milies and had also greatly prospered them by increasing their flocks
2 CONC and herds, they found themselves much hampered for room for their catt
2 CONC le to feed. On May 31, 1660, a grant of six square miles was set off f
2 CONC or their needs and this country was known as Whippin and afterwards in
2 CONC  corporated as Marlborough. In this grant, John Maynard II was assigne
2 CONC d a good area in the central part of the present city of Marlborough.
2 CONC John III went to this grant and settled, and married Mary Gates. In hi
2 CONC s father's will, he stated that he had already deeded this property to
2 CONC  John III. Thus all the descentants by the name of Maynard in Marlboro
2 CONC ugh, Southboro, Westborough and Shewsbury come from John III, while mo
2 CONC st of the families in Framingham and various parts of Sudbury and Wayl
2 CONC and come from John, the II.
2 CONT
2 CONC John Maynard died in Sudbury on December 10, 1672. His will was dated
2 CONC September 4, 1672 and proved April 1, 1673. In it are mentioned his el
2 CONC dest son John Maynard, son Zachery, wife Mary, daughter Elisabeth wife
2 CONC  of Joseph Graves, daughter Lydia wife to Joseph Moore, and youngest d
2 CONC aughter Mary, not yet married. His wife Mary and son Zachery were name
2 CONC d joint executors. "My trusty friends Deacon John Haines, and Joseph N
2 CONC oys both of Sudbury" were to be supervisors to assist the executors. T
2 CONC he will was witnessed by Henry Locker and John Toll.[5] The inventory
2 CONC of the estate was taken December 30, 1672 by Edmund Goodenow, John Hai
2 CONC nes, and Joseph Noyes and came to 263 pounds.

2 CONT == Biography ==
2 CONT John Allis resided in Hatfield, near his Father William,
2 CONT owning a lot on the same side of Hatfield street, and was
2 CONT one of the prominent citizens of that town. He was a
2 CONT millwright and carpenter of note. He built many churches
2 CONT and was erecting the first corn mill at Mill River when he
2 CONT died. He was the first town clerk of Hatfield, and was
2 CONT one of a committee of six appointed to make a survey of
2 CONT and lay out highways between Hadley and Windsor, Conn.
2 CONT He served in King Philip’s War and was in the fight at
2 CONT Great Falls on May 19, 1676. Afterwards he was a

2 CONT
2 CONT At the time of the Hatfield massacre on September 19, 1677,
2 CONC the mother of John Allis was killed, his bam burned, and his six-year-

2 CONT of the seventeen prisoners taken. On the same day the Indians went
2 CONT north to Deerfield, where they killed one and captured four men, and
2 CONT then went across the country to Lake Champlain and Canada.
2 CONT During the march to Canada one of the men was burned at the stake
2 CONT and two other captives were killed, and all endured much suffering.
2 CONT The trip through the wilderness was a most difficult one.
2 CONT
2 CONT The prisoners were held in Canada by the French until ran-
2 CONT somed eight months later through the efforts of two of the Hatfield
2 CONT settlers, Benjamin Waite and Stephen Jennings, whose families were
2 CONC among the captives. The party reached Albany on May 22 and eventually
2 CONC arrived a
2 CONT Hatfield safely.
2 CONT
2 CONC Husband of Mary Meekins Clark Allis. Her first husband was Nathaniel C
2 CONC lark, and she married, third, Samuel Belding.
2 CONT

2 CONC bod Allis, Eleazer Allis, Elizabeth Allis Bridgeman, Lydia Allis, John
2 CONC  Allis Jr, Rebecca Allis Graves, William Allis, Mary Allis, and Nathan

2 CONT
2 CONC It is worth noting that entries before and after William's entry list
2 CONC unambiguously use a day month year format. Based on this, his DOB woul
2 CONC d be 10th day of November 1655.  However, since this was an area of  Q
2 CONC uakers/Puritans; the date in their format/conventions (until 1752) wou
2 CONC ld render this date as '''11 month''' .
2 CONC 11th month would be January, since their calendar starts with March as
2 CONC  the first month of the year.  William's birth year would run from Mar
2 CONC ch 1655 to February 1656. So, his DOB would be 10 January 1656, assumi

2 CONC At first, there appeared to be TWO Obediah Leonards born about 1827 in
2 CONC  Tennessee, both living in Jackson County - one in District 4, the oth

2 CONC Jonathan Wynne came to America at age 13. He built a large stone house
2 CONC  named Wynnstay in Blockley Township, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvani
2 CONC a.
2 CONC ::''please note that the Sarah Graves who married Edward Stebbins is a

2 CONC : "Was researching Graves family that settled on property my family no

2 CONC  Google, page 1363. Re: 8th generation of Wynne family at site: Sarah
2 CONC Graves, born 1659, who married the first Jonathan Wynne, was the daugh

2 CONC h may first have married Edward Stebbins in 1679, but in 1694 married
2 CONC Jonathan Wynne. How she got to PA is a mystery. She seems also to have
2 CONC  brought a Greaves brother or cousin, as a male Greaves owned our prop

2 CONC was 15 years old, probably causing him to leave the community. We know

2 CONC ghshire, Wales when he became a Quaker between 1654 and 1655. He marri
2 CONC ed his first wife Martha Elizabeth Buttall in 1655 in Wrexham, Denbigh
2 CONC shire, Wales. Dr. Thomas Wynne also satisfied Dr. Walter Needham and D
2 CONC r. Hollins of his competence and was duly licensed as a qualified barb
2 CONC er-surgeon during the year 1659. We know that he had his first four ch
2 CONC ildren; Mary 1659, Tabitha 1661, Rebecca 1662 and Sidney 1664 all born
2 CONC  in Wrexham, Denbighshire, Wales. Which demonstrates that Dr. Thomas W

2 CONT == Biography ==
2 CONT === Parentage; Date and Place of Birth ===
2 CONC Martha Hayward was the daughter of  [[Hayward-270|Thomas Hayward, Sr.]
2 CONC ] and his wife [[Towne-491|Susanna (Unknown) Hayward]].<ref name="GM3p
2 CONC 292"/> Based on the fact that Martha's name was included among Thomas'
2 CONC s family members enrolled for passage to New England aboard the ''Herc
2 CONC ules'', under a minister's certification dated March 14, 1634/5, <ref
2 CONC name="NEHGR75p219"/><ref name="GM3p288"/> she was born sometime before
2 CONC  that date. Anderson estimates that she was born "say 1635,"<ref name=
2 CONC "GM3p292"/> apparently based on the date he estimated for her parents'
2 CONC  marriage and for her siblings' dates of birth. However, since all tho
2 CONC se dates seem to be rough estimates and the window for her birth in 16
2 CONC 35 is very small, it is very possible (if not likely) that Martha was
2 CONC born somewhat earlier.  Since the ''Hercules'' passenger lists states
2 CONC that Thomas and his family were from Aylesford, England, Martha was ve
2 CONC ry probably born there.<ref name="NEHGR75p219"/><ref name="GM3p288"/>
2 CONT
2 CONT === Emigration to New England ===
2 CONC Martha and her family sailed from Sandwich, England to New England in
2 CONC 1635 aboard the ship ''Hercules'', John Witherley, master.<ref name="N
2 CONC EHGR75p219"/><ref name="Hotten"/><ref name="GM3p288"/> They settled fi
2 CONC rst at Cambridge, Massachusetts.<ref name="GM3p288"/>
2 CONT
2 CONT === Removal to Duxbury ===
2 CONC Martha's family moved from Cambridge to Duxbury by 1638.<ref name="GM3
2 CONC p289"/>
2 CONT
2 CONT === "Vain, Light and Lascivious Carriage" ===
2 CONC At a Grand Inquest on June 8, 1651, Martha Haward of Duxbury, along wi
2 CONC th John Shaw, James Shaw, Samuel Cutbert and Benjamin Eaton of Plymout
2 CONC h and Goodwife Gannett and William Snow of Duxbury, were presented for
2 CONC  "vaine, light and lacivius carriage at an unseasonable time of night.
2 CONC "<ref name="PCR2p170"/><ref name="GM3p292"/> At the General Court at N
2 CONC ew Plymouth on October 7, 1651, the Court, "not finding them alike fau
2 CONC lty, have fined James Shaw and Goodwife Ganett thirty shillings apeace
2 CONC  . . . and Samuell Cutbert, William Snow, Benjamine Eaton and Martha H
2 CONC award are released, with admonishion to take heed of such evell carria
2 CONC ges for the future. And as for John Shaw, he is lyable to punishment w
2 CONC hen oppertunitie serveth."<ref name="PCR2p172"/>
2 CONT
2 CONT === Marriage ===
2 CONC Martha married John Haward/Howard.<ref name="GM3p292"/><ref name="Mitc
2 CONC hell191-2"/><ref name="Savage2p471"/><ref name="Howard1"/> The first n
2 CONC ame of John Haward/Howard's wife is confirmed by records of the divisi
2 CONC on of his estate, which refer to his widow Martha.<ref name="Howard3-4
2 CONC "/> The identity of John Haward/Howard's wife as a daughter of Thomas
2 CONC Hayward is confirmed by a quitclaim by John's children of rights to pr
2 CONC operty bequeathed by Peter Town to Thomas Hayward's children.<ref name
2 CONC ="MiddlesexDeeds23p398"/><ref name="GM3p292"/><ref name="GM3p293"/>
2 CONT
2 CONC Some family trees state that Martha and John were married on April 6,
2 CONC 1657 in Dennis, Barnstable County. However, both the date and location
2 CONC  seem very improbable, and no reliable sources supporting either that
2 CONC date or location have been found. Based on the estimated dates of birt
2 CONC h of their children, Martha and John were probably married sometime in
2 CONC  1652-1655. Consistent with this range, Anderson states that they were
2 CONC  married "by about 1655."<ref name="GM3p292"/> Since both Thomas Haywa
2 CONC rd and John Haward/Howard were residents of Duxbury during that time p
2 CONC eriod (and Bridgewater was not incorporated until 1656), they were pro
2 CONC bably married there.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Children ===

2 CONT
2 CONT == Biography ==
2 CONT
2 CONT === Origin ===
2 CONC The origin (last residence prior to emigrating to New England) of Thom
2 CONC as Hayward of Duxbury and Bridgewater was Aylesford, Kent. His place o
2 CONC f origin is established by a record showing the enrollment for passage
2 CONC  to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', under a minister's certificat
2 CONC ion dated March 14, 1634/5, of "Thos Hayward of Aylesford in Kent Tayl
2 CONC or & Susanna his Wief" and children "Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan, a
2 CONC nd Martha."<ref name="NEHGR75p219"/><ref name="Boys751"/><ref name="Ho
2 CONC ttenxix"/><ref name="GM3p288"/>
2 CONT
2 CONT === Date and Place of Birth ===
2 CONC Thomas's date and place of birth are uncertain. Many family trees stat
2 CONC e that Thomas was born in Aylesford, Kent. Since (as established by th
2 CONC e ''Hercules'' passenger list referenced in "Origin" above) Thomas was
2 CONC  living in Aylesford before he emigrated, it is reasonably plausible t
2 CONC hat he was born there. However, no record of his birth or baptism has
2 CONC been found. If Thomas was born and baptized in Aylesford, it is unlike
2 CONC ly that any record of his birth or baptism will ever be found, as no r
2 CONC ecords appear to exist for Aylesford, Saints Peter and Paul Parish pri
2 CONC or to 1654.<ref name="Aylesford"/>
2 CONT
2 CONC Based on his estimated date of marriage (sometime in 1620-1628), Thoma
2 CONC s was probably born sometime in 1595-1607. Anderson estimated his date
2 CONC  of birth as "by about 1599," based on an estimated date of marriage o
2 CONC f "by about 1624."<ref name="GM3p291"/> An estimate of "about 1600" se
2 CONC ems better, however, given his 1595-1607 estimated birth range and the
2 CONC  false precision suggested by "about 1599."
2 CONT
2 CONT === Parentage ===
2 CONC Thomas's parentage has not been established. A number of unsourced fam
2 CONC ily trees claim that Thomas was the son of a Thomas Hayward and an Agn
2 CONC es (Beaumon) Hayward of Aylesford, Kent. However, no reliable source h
2 CONC as been found for that parentage or even their existence.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Marriage ===
2 CONC The ''Hercules'' passenger list referenced in "Origin" above establish
2 CONC es that Thomas was married to a woman named Susanna.<ref name="NEHGR75
2 CONC p219"/><ref name="Hottenxix"/><ref name="GM3p288"/> As discussed in [[
2 CONC Towne-491|her profile]], Susanna's maiden name may have been Towne, bu
2 CONC t that is uncertain.
2 CONT
2 CONC Thomas and Susanna's date and place of marriage are uncertain. Since t
2 CONC he ''Hercules'' passenger list establishes that Thomas and Susanna wer
2 CONC e residents of Aylesford, Kent, it is reasonably likely that they were
2 CONC  married there or in a nearby parish. If they were married in Aylesfor
2 CONC d, it is unlikely that any marriage record will ever be found, since,
2 CONC as discussed above, no records appear to exist for Aylesford, Saints P
2 CONC eter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.<ref name="Aylesford"/>
2 CONT
2 CONC Based on the fact that the ''Hercules'' passenger list shows that Thom
2 CONC as and Susanna had 5 children as of March 1634/5, and assuming the fir
2 CONC st child was born 1 year after their marriage and assuming a 2-year ga
2 CONC p between births, one derives an estimated marriage date of sometime i
2 CONC n 1624-1627. Based on the possibility of miscarriages, still births, c
2 CONC hildren who died young, and longer gaps between births, they could wel
2 CONC l have been married as early as, say, 1620. Based on the possibility o
2 CONC f twins or shorter gaps between births, they could have been married a
2 CONC s late as 1628. Anderson estimates that they were married "by about 16
2 CONC 24,"<ref name="GM3p291"/> although this suggests that 1624 was the lat
2 CONC er end of the possible range when, instead, it appears to be a reasona
2 CONC ble midpoint.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Emigration to New England ===
2 CONC As discussed above under "Origin," Thomas, his wife Susanna and his fi
2 CONC ve eldest children, Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan and Martha, emigrat
2 CONC ed to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', which departed Sandwich, En
2 CONC gland for New England in March 1634/5.<ref name="NEHGR75p219"/><ref na
2 CONC me="Boys751"/><ref name="Hottenxix"/><ref name="GM3p288"/>
2 CONT
2 CONC The passenger list for the ''William & Francis'', which embarked at Lo
2 CONC ndon on March 7, 1631/2 and arrived in Boston on June 5, 1632, include
2 CONC d a "Thomas Haeward."<ref name="Hotten149"/><ref name="GMB2p900"/> Sav
2 CONC age suggested that this record might also relate to this profile's Tho
2 CONC mas Hayward and might show that Thomas first came to New England with
2 CONC Winslow in 1632 and, satisfied with the prospects, went home to bring
2 CONC his family.<ref name="Savage2p394"/> Anderson found no evidence either
2 CONC  for or against this proposition.<ref name="GMB2p900"/><ref name="GM3p
2 CONC 292"/>
2 CONT
2 CONT === Residency at Cambridge; First Record in New England ===
2 CONC Thomas and his family appear to have initially settled in Cambridge in
2 CONC  the Massachusetts Bay Colony.<ref name="GM3p288"/> The first known re
2 CONC cord of Thomas in New England is the grant to him on January 4, 1635 b
2 CONC y the town of Cambridge of "about 2 Acks wthin wstend ffeild gate beyo
2 CONC nd the Clay pits."<ref name="CaTR15"/> No further records have been fo
2 CONC und of Thomas or his family in Cambridge.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Residency at Duxbury and Bridgewater ===
2 CONC Thomas appears to have moved from Cambridge to Duxbury in the Plymouth
2 CONC  Colony by 1638. The first record of Thomas at Duxbury is a grant to h
2 CONC im by the Plymouth Colony Court of Assistant held on November 5, 1638
2 CONC of 10 acres of land "lying on the Duxborrow side."<ref name="PCR1p101"
2 CONC /> He received additional grants of land in Duxbury in 1640.<ref name=
2 CONC "PCR1p144"/><ref name="PCR1p161"/>
2 CONT
2 CONC Thomas was admitted as a Freeman in 1647<ref name="PCR2p114"/> and was
2 CONC  chosen as constable of Duxbury in 1648.<ref name="PCR2p123"/>
2 CONT
2 CONC Thomas was one of the original proprietors of the Duxborrow new planta
2 CONC tion,<ref name="Mitchell10-1"/><ref name="Mitchell26"/> which was inco
2 CONC rporated as the town of Bridgewater in 1656.<ref name="PCR3p101"/>
2 CONT
2 CONC By 1658, Thomas was living in Bridgewater. He was included in lists of
2 CONC  freemen of Bridgewater in 1658<ref name="PCR8p202"/> and 1670.<ref na
2 CONC me="PCR5p278"/>
2 CONT
2 CONT === Children ===

2 CONC esumably in Duxbury,<ref name="ParentsResidence"/> m. about 1668 Edwar
2 CONC d Mitchell<ref name="GM3p292"/>
2 CONC The 1907 ''Dunham Genealogy'' states, without providing any source or
2 CONC explanation, that Thomas also had a daughter named Mehitable, born abo
2 CONC ut 1643, who married [[Dunham-170|Daniel Dunham]] in 1668.<ref name="D
2 CONC unham300"/> No reliable evidence has been found for Thomas having had
2 CONC any such daughter, however, and Anderson doesn't even mention the theo
2 CONC ry. A 1954 article in TAG concluded that, contrary to the assertion in
2 CONC  ''Dunham Genealogy'', Daniel Dunham's wife was named Hannah and that
2 CONC her maiden name was undetermined.<ref name="TAG30p146"/>
2 CONT
2 CONT === Will; Death; Estate ===
2 CONC Thomas made his will on June 29, 1678. In his will, he described himse
2 CONC lf as "Thomas Heyward Senior of Bridgwater of Bridgewater in ye Colony
2 CONC  of New Plymouth yeoman." He made bequests to his son Joseph, son Elis
2 CONC ha, and grandson Joseph Heyward, and mentioned lands he had previously
2 CONC  given to his son Nathaniel. He named his son Joseph as his executor.
2 CONC The will was witnessed by William Brett Sr and Thomas Hayward Junr.<re

2 CONT
2 CONC The inventory of Thomas's estate was taken on March 8, 1680/1 by Elder
2 CONC  Brett and Lieutenant Hayward and totaled £46 11s 9d, with no real es
2 CONC tate listed. The Inventory shows that he possessed "Mr. Sheppards book

2 CONC nvert. Mr. Ralph Allen of ye riches of the covenant of grace, also his

2 CONT == Biography ==
2 CONT
2 CONT === Relationship to William and Peter Towne ===
2 CONC Either Susanna or her husband [[Hayward-270|Thomas Hayward]] was relat
2 CONC ed to [[Towne-494|Peter Towne]] and his father [[Towne-493|William Tow
2 CONC ne]]. The will of Peter Towne includes a bequest to his "first cousins
2 CONC  at Bridgewater" Nathaniel Howard, Joseph Howard, Elisha Howard and Ma
2 CONC ry Mitchell,<ref name="PeterWill"/><ref name="NEHGR20p370"/><ref name=
2 CONC "GM7p78"/> who were children of [[Hayward-270|Thomas Hayward]] and his
2 CONC  wife Susanna.<ref name="GM7p78"/> Some genealogists seem to have conc
2 CONC luded that this means that Susanna, the wife of Thomas Hayward, was Wi
2 CONC lliam Towne's sister. Foremost among these was Clarence Almon Torrey.
2 CONC In his 1945 TAG article ''Some Ancestral Lines of President William Ho
2 CONC ward Taft'', he stated (without sources or discussion) that Thomas Hay
2 CONC ward married Susanna Towne.<ref name="TAG22p205"/> In addition, the en
2 CONC try for Thomas Hayward's marriage in Torrey's ''New England Marriages
2 CONC to 1700'' has Susanna's maiden name of "[Towne]" in brackets but witho
2 CONC ut a question mark, indicating that, although no marriage record had b
2 CONC een found, Torrey was confident that her maiden name was Towne. None o
2 CONC f the sources listed by Torrey, however, provide any useful evidence f
2 CONC or Susanna's last name beyond the language of Peter Towne's will and n
2 CONC one, except Torrey's own 1945 TAG article and one source that explicit
2 CONC ly relied on it, claim that her maiden name was Towne.<ref name="Torre
2 CONC ys"/> It is unclear why Torrey felt confident that Susanna's maiden na
2 CONC me was Towne, as there are three (seemingly equally probable) ways in
2 CONC which Thomas and Susanna Hayward's children could have been Peter Town
2 CONC e's cousins:
2 CONC # Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna could have been the sister of William
2 CONC Towne. In that case, Susanna's maiden name would have been Towne and t
2 CONC he maiden name of William's wife Martha would be unknown.
2 CONC # Thomas Hayward could have been the sister of William Town's wife Mar
2 CONC tha. In that case, Martha's maiden name would have been Hayward and th
2 CONC e maiden name of Thomas's wife Susanna would be unknown.
2 CONC # Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna could have been the sister of William
2 CONC Towne's wife Martha. In that case, the maiden name of both Susanna and
2 CONC  Martha would be unknown.
2 CONC No evidence has been found that favors one of these possibilities over
2 CONC  another. Anderson declined to adopt Torrey's theory that the maiden n
2 CONC ame of Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna was Towne and instead concluded t
2 CONC hat the relationship between the children of Thomas and Susanna Haywar
2 CONC d and Peter Towne has not been determined.<ref name="GM7p78"/>
2 CONT
2 CONT === Maiden Name; Parentage ===
2 CONC Susanna's maiden name is uncertain. As discussed above under "Relation
2 CONC ship to William and Peter Towne," it is quite possible that she was th
2 CONC e sister of William Towne and thus her maiden name was Towne. However,
2 CONC  it is also quite possible, if not probable, that she was not the sist
2 CONC er of William Towne, in which case, there would be no reason to think
2 CONC that her maiden name was Towne and her maiden name is unknown.
2 CONT
2 CONC Even if she was William Towne's sister, her parentage would be unknown
2 CONC , since, as discussed in [[Towne-493|William's profile]], his parentag
2 CONC e is unknown.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Origin ===
2 CONC The origin (last residence prior to emigrating to New England) of Susa
2 CONC nna, the wife of Thomas Hayward of Duxbury and Bridgewater, was Aylesf
2 CONC ord, Kent. Her place of origin is established by a record showing the
2 CONC enrollment for passage to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', under a
2 CONC  minister's certification dated March 14, 1634/5, of "Thos Hayward of
2 CONC Aylesford in Kent Taylor & Susanna his Wief" and children "Thomas, Joh
2 CONC n, Elizabeth, Susan, and Martha."<ref name="NEHGR75p219"/><ref name="B
2 CONC oys751"/><ref name="Hottenxix"/><ref name="GM3p288"/>
2 CONT
2 CONT === Date and Place of Birth ===
2 CONC Susanna's date and place of birth are uncertain. Many family trees sta
2 CONC te that Susanna was born in Aylesford, Kent. Since (as established by
2 CONC the ''Hercules'' passenger list referenced in "Origin" above) Susanna
2 CONC was living in Aylesford before she emigrated, it is reasonably plausib
2 CONC le that she was born there. However, no record of her birth or baptism
2 CONC  has been found. If Susanna was born and baptized in Aylesford, it is
2 CONC unlikely that any record of her birth or baptism will ever be found, a
2 CONC s no records appear to exist for Aylesford, Saints Peter and Paul Pari
2 CONC sh prior to 1654.<ref name="Aylesford"/>
2 CONT
2 CONC Based on her estimated date of marriage (sometime in 1620-1628), Susan
2 CONC na was probably born sometime in 1595-1610, with "about 1602" as a rea
2 CONC sonable midpoint estimate.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Marriage ===
2 CONC Susanna and Thomas Hayward's date and place of marriage are uncertain.
2 CONC  Since the ''Hercules'' passenger list establishes that Susanna and Th
2 CONC omas were residents of Aylesford, Kent, it is reasonably likely that t
2 CONC hey were married there or in a nearby parish. If they were married in
2 CONC Aylesford, it is unlikely that any marriage record will ever be found,
2 CONC  since, as discussed above, no records appear to exist for Aylesford,
2 CONC Saints Peter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.<ref name="Aylesford"/>
2 CONT
2 CONC Based on the fact that the ''Hercules'' passenger list shows that Susa
2 CONC nna and Thomas had 5 children as of March 1634/5, and assuming the fir
2 CONC st child was born 1 year after their marriage and assuming a 2-year ga
2 CONC p between births, one derives an estimated marriage date of sometime i
2 CONC n 1624-1627. Based on the possibility of miscarriages, still births, c
2 CONC hildren who died young, and longer gaps between births, they could wel
2 CONC l have been married as early as, say, 1620. Based on the possibility o
2 CONC f twins or shorter gaps between births, they could have been married a
2 CONC s late as 1628. Anderson estimates that they were married "by about 16
2 CONC 24,"<ref name="GM3p291"/> although this suggests that 1624 was the lat
2 CONC er end of the possible range when, instead, it appears to be a reasona
2 CONC ble midpoint.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Emigration to New England ===
2 CONC As discussed above under "Origin," Susanna, her husband Thomas, and th
2 CONC eir five eldest children, Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan and Martha, e
2 CONC migrated to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', which departed Sandwi
2 CONC ch, England for New England in March 1634/5.<ref name="NEHGR75p219"/><
2 CONC ref name="Boys751"/><ref name="Hottenxix"/><ref name="GM3p288"/>
2 CONT
2 CONT === Residency at Cambridge, Duxbury and Bridgewater ===
2 CONC As discussed in the profile for her husband, [[Hayward-270|Thomas Hayw
2 CONC ard]], Susanna and her family appear to have initially settled in Camb
2 CONC ridge in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, moved to Duxbury in the Plymout
2 CONC h Colony by 1638, and finally moved to Bridgewater by 1658.

2 CONT
2 CONT == Biography ==
2 CONT === Name ===
2 CONC Original records for this profile's John Howard of Bridgewater consist
2 CONC ently spell his name as "Haward," with a few exceptions that spell his
2 CONC  name "Heyward," "Hayward" or "Heward."<ref name="Records"/> No origin
2 CONC al record has been found that spells his name "Howard" during his life
2 CONC time, although Mitchell assures us that that is how his name was prono
2 CONC unced.<ref name="Mitchell191-2"/>
2 CONT
2 CONC He was often referred to in the original records by his military title
2 CONC  of "Ensign" subsequent to his appointment to that position in 1664 an
2 CONC d as "Lieutenant" subsequent to his promotion to that position in 1689
2 CONC .<ref name="Records"/> He was also sometimes referred to in the origin
2 CONC al records as John Haward Senior in order to distinguish him from his
2 CONC younger brother-in-law, John Hayward/Haward.<ref name="Records"/> ("Se
2 CONC nior" was not needed to distinguish him from his son John at the time
2 CONC Senior was used in the records, as his son was still quite young at th
2 CONC e time of those records.)
2 CONT
2 CONT === Earliest Plymouth Records ===
2 CONT The earliest Plymouth Colony records of a John Haward/Heyward are:
2 CONC * A June 7, 1637 list of names of soldiers willing to to assist the co
2 CONC lonies of Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut in their wars against the
2 CONC Pequin Indians, which includes the name "John Heyward."<ref name="PCR1
2 CONC p61"/>
2 CONC * A record of a grant at a Plymouth town meeting on October 17, 1642 t
2 CONC o "John Heyward" of a garden place next Andrew Ringe and 10 acres of u
2 CONC pland at Fresh Lake by the fishing point.<ref name="PCR2p48"/>
2 CONC Curiously, none of the secondary sources for this profile's John Hawar
2 CONC d/Heyward mention those records.
2 CONT
2 CONC The first record of this profile's John Haward/Heyward mentioned in se
2 CONC condary sources is a 1643 list of names of males in Duxbury aged 16-60
2 CONC  able to bear arms, which includes the name "John Heyward."<ref name="
2 CONC PCR8p190"/><ref name="Mitchell191-2"/><ref name="Savage2p471"/><ref na
2 CONC me="Howard1"/>
2 CONT
2 CONC There is some evidence that there might have been two John Heywards in
2 CONC  the Plymouth Colony. The same 1643 list of names of males aged 16-60
2 CONC able to bear arms includes two John Heywards: one in Plymouth<ref name
2 CONC ="PCR8p188"/> and one in Duxbury. In addition, the 1657 record of men
2 CONC taking the oath of fidelity in the Plymouth Colony includes two John H
2 CONC awards: one in Plymouth<ref name="PCR8p181"/> and one in Bridgewater.<
2 CONC ref name="PCR8p185"/> Assuming that the same person was not listed in
2 CONC two towns, it thus seems likely that there was a John Heyward/Haward o
2 CONC f Plymouth and a John Heyward/Haward of Duxbury/Bridgewater and that t
2 CONC he 1637 and 1642 Plymouth Colony records for John Heyward relate to th
2 CONC e former.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Parentage; Date and Place of Birth ===
2 CONC John's parentage is unknown, except perhaps for the first name of his
2 CONC mother. The "Howard Genealogy" contains a copy of a letter dated Augus
2 CONC t 16, 1652 by a Mary Hayward in London to her son John Hayward in New
2 CONC England that was in the possession of a member of the Howard family an
2 CONC d was supposedly written to this profile's John Haward/Hayward.<ref na
2 CONC me="Howardxvi"/> (An image purportedly of the original letter is attac
2 CONC hed to this profile.) Assuming that letter is authentic and relates to
2 CONC  this profile's John Haward/Hayward, his mother's name was Mary and sh
2 CONC e was living in London in 1652. Some family trees say that John was th
2 CONC e son of a James Howard/Haward and a Mary Cooper, but no reliable evid
2 CONC ence for that parentage has been found.
2 CONT
2 CONC John's date of birth is uncertain. Assuming that the secondary sources
2 CONC  are correct and that the first record of this profile's John Haward/H
2 CONC eyward is the 1643 list of males of Duxborrow 16-60 years old able to
2 CONC bear arms (and not the earlier Plymouth records for a "John Heyward"),
2 CONC  John was probably born sometime in 1623-1627 based on (i) the fact th
2 CONC at his inclusion in the 1643 list means that he was at least 16 in 164
2 CONC 3 and thus born no later than 1627 and (ii) the fact that the earliest
2 CONC  estimated date of birth of one of his children (1653) suggests that h
2 CONC e was probably not older than 30 years old at that date and thus was p
2 CONC robably born no earlier than 1623. If, on the other hand, the 1637 rec
2 CONC ord for "John Heyward" relates to this profiles John Haward/Heyward, h
2 CONC e was probably born no later than 1621 (since, to volunteer for milita
2 CONC ry service, he probably needed to be at least 16 years old).
2 CONT
2 CONC John's place of birth is also uncertain. It is very likely that he was
2 CONC  born in England.  Some family trees say that John was born in Sandwic
2 CONC h, Kent, but no reliable evidence supporting that proposition has been
2 CONC  found. Assuming the letter referred to above is authentic and relates
2 CONC  to this profile's John Howard, it is quite possible that he was born
2 CONC in London, since his mother was living there in 1652.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Immigration to New England ===
2 CONC John Haward's date of immigration is uncertain and his means of immigr
2 CONC ation are unknown. Based on the assumption that John was the "John Hey
2 CONC ward" included in a 1643 list of men of Duxbury, Plymouth Colony 16-60
2 CONC  years old able to bear arms,<ref name="PCR8p190"/><ref name="Mitchell
2 CONC 191-2"/><ref name="Savage2p471"/><ref name="Howard1"/> he immigrated s
2 CONC ometime before that date.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Age at Immigration; Brought up by Miles Standish? ===
2 CONC Based on John's estimated date of birth (1623-1627), John was still a
2 CONC minor when he immigrated. This is consistent with "History of the Earl
2 CONC y Settlement of Bridgewater," which states that John "was young when h
2 CONC e came over,"<ref name="Mitchell191-2"/> and with  the "Howard Genealo
2 CONC gy", which states (without support) that John was about 15 when he imm
2 CONC igrated.<ref name="Howard1"/>
2 CONT
2 CONC Secondary sources suggest that John arrived without his parents and li
2 CONC ved, for a time, with Miles Standish, who resided in Duxbury. Accordin
2 CONC g to "History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater," "it is said, [t
2 CONC hat John] lived in Capt. Miles Standish's family,"<ref name="Mitchell1
2 CONC 91-2"/> while Savage (writing after Mitchell) stated that John was "on
2 CONC e of the first sett. brot. up by Capt. Miles Standish."<ref name="Sava
2 CONC ge2p471"/>
2 CONT
2 CONT === Brother James or George? ===
2 CONC According to "History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater," John im
2 CONC migrated with a brother named James, who subsequently moved to Bermuda
2 CONC .<ref name="Mitchell191-2"/> The "Howard Genealogy," however, states t
2 CONC hat he immigrated with a brother named George.<ref name="Howard1"/> Th
2 CONC e source for "George" in the "Howard Genealogy" appears to be the lett
2 CONC er referenced above by Mary Hayward to John Hayward in New England, wh
2 CONC ich also references her son George Hayward and niece Sarah, also in Ne
2 CONC w England.<ref name="Howardxvi"/> Some additional support for the prop
2 CONC osition that John had a brother named George is provided by the fact t
2 CONC hat a "Gorg Haward" took the oath of fidelity in Barnstable, Plymouth
2 CONC Colony in 1657,<ref name="PCR8p179"/> the same year that John took the
2 CONC  oath in Bridgewater.
2 CONT
2 CONC If, as the evidence suggests, John and his brother James/George immigr
2 CONC ated as teenagers without their parents, they may well have ended up i
2 CONC n the care of different families, which would help explain why George
2 CONC ended up settling in Barnstable, while John settled in Duxbury and Bri
2 CONC dgewater.
2 CONT
2 CONT ===  Residency in Duxbury; Removal to Bridgewater ===
2 CONC Based on the inclusion of the name of "John Heyward" in the 1643 list
2 CONC of names of males in Duxbury aged 16-60 able to bear arms,<ref name="P
2 CONC CR8p190"/> John was living in Duxbury at that date.<ref name="Mitchell
2 CONC 191-2"/>
2 CONT
2 CONC The town of Bridgewater started as a grant of additional land to the i
2 CONC nhabitants of Duxbury.<ref name="Mitchell9-13"/> John Haward was one o
2 CONC f the original proprietors of the Duxborrow new plantation,<ref name="
2 CONC Mitchell10-1"/><ref name="Howard1"/> which supports the proposition th
2 CONC at John Haward of Bridgewater was the same person as John Heyward of D
2 CONC uxbury. According to "History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater"
2 CONC and the "Howard Genealogy," John moved to what would become Bridgewate
2 CONC r about 1651.<ref name="Mitchell191-2"/> The Duxborrow new plantation
2 CONC was incorporated as the town of Bridgewater in 1656.<ref name="PCR3p10
2 CONC 1"/>
2 CONT
2 CONT === Marriage ===
2 CONC John married [[Hayward-769|Martha Hayward]], daughter of Thomas Haywar
2 CONC d.<ref name="GM3p292"/><ref name="Mitchell191-2"/><ref name="Savage2p4
2 CONC 71"/><ref name="Howard1"/> Her first name is confirmed by records of t
2 CONC he division of his estate, which refer to his widow Martha.<ref name="
2 CONC Howard3-4"/> Her identity as a daughter of Thomas Hayward is confirmed
2 CONC  by a quitclaim by John's children of rights to property bequeathed by
2 CONC  Peter Town to Thomas Hayward's children.<ref name="MiddlesexDeeds23p3
2 CONC 98"/><ref name="GM3p292"/><ref name="GM3p293"/>
2 CONT
2 CONC Some family trees state that John and Martha were married on April 6,
2 CONC 1657 in Dennis, Barnstable County. However, both the date and location
2 CONC  seem very improbable, and no reliable sources supporting either that
2 CONC date or location have been found. Based on the estimated dates of birt
2 CONC h of their children, John and Martha were probably married sometime in
2 CONC  1652-1655. Consistent with this range, Anderson states that they were
2 CONC  married "by about 1655."<ref name="GM3p292"/> Since both John and Tho
2 CONC mas Hayward were residents of Duxbury during that time period (and Bri
2 CONC dgewater was not incorporated until 1656), they were probably married
2 CONC there.
2 CONT
2 CONT === Children ===
2 CONT John and Martha had the following children:

2 CONT
2 CONC It appears reasonably likely that John actually died sometime in 1701
2 CONC rather than in 1700. The inventory of his estate was taken by Thomas S

2 CONC  the inventory to be taken within a month or so after the deceased's d
2 CONC eath, the date of his estate inventory suggests that John died in 1701
2 CONC .
2 CONT
2 CONC The inventory of John's estate included his house and homelands, about
2 CONC  400 additional acres of land, two servants, and over £112 owed to hi

2 CONC  colonists and their Native American allies in 1675–78. The war is n
2 CONC amed after the main leader of the Native American side, Metacomet, kno

2 CONC he Puritan hero of the war; it was his company of Puritan rangers and
2 CONC Native American allies that finally hunted down and killed King Philip
2 CONC  on August 12, 1676. The war continued in northern New England (primar
2 CONC ily in Maine at the New England and Acadia border) until a treaty was
2 CONC signed at Casco Bay in April 1678.
2 CONC The war was the single greatest calamity to occur in seventeenth-centu

2 CONC e of the region's towns were destroyed and many more damaged, the colo
2 CONC ny's economy was all but ruined, and much of its population was killed

2 CONT :  Notes for Nathaniel Hayward:
2 CONC :  By trade Nathaniel was a carpenter and lived in Beverly although of
2 CONC ten he is called "of Salem." He was on the Grand Jury in 1669, and a t
2 CONC ythingman in 1677. In 1675 Nathaniel Hayward, aged about 33, testified
2 CONC  that at Beverly town meeting he observed that part of the persons tha
2 CONC t voted were not Freemen. In 1692 he was named in a deed as "Cornet Na
2 CONC thaniel Howard Senr."
2 CONT :
2 CONC :  When the New Englanders under Major Sedgwick captured Port Royal fr
2 CONC om the French in 1654, Capt. Lothrop asked the Major for a bell which
2 CONC hung in a friary and was part of the spoils in which he intended to ha
2 CONC ng in the church at the settlement which was to become Beverly. The be
2 CONC ll was sent to Salem in Capt. Richard More's kletch and was taken by B
2 CONC everly men in More's absence without any bill of lading or payment to
2 CONC More. Twenty-five years later More sued and won. Nathaniel Hayward, ag
2 CONC ed about 27, deposed that being in company with Capt. More, about two
2 CONC years ago, he told them that the bell which is at Beverly was for Capt
2 CONC . Lowthrop but, said More, "you Beverly men did steal ye bell in yt yo
2 CONC u took ye bell without order when I was not at home."
2 CONC :  Nathaniel's will is headed "Mr. Nathaniel Hayward's Will of Salem"
2 CONC and it is dated 1 May 1719. He states that he had already settled the
2 CONC greater part of his estate by giving land to his children and grandchi
2 CONC ldren by deed, namely to the children of his son Nathaniel and to his
2 CONC sons Nehemiah, Jonathan, Nicholas, Samuel and Stephen. He had also giv
2 CONC en to his daughters Elizabeth Kettle, Abigail Flint, Sarah Coburn and
2 CONC Hannah Vickery as they "married away from me." To his sons Nehemiah an
2 CONC d Samuel, a parcel of land, 100 acres, which he had bought of his son
2 CONC Jonathan, lying in the town of Belden. To his son Stephen, the rest of
2 CONC  his personal estate. For love and affection to his kinswoman Hannah C
2 CONC oit, daughter of his brother Nehemiah Haywood Ð5. To his daughters El
2 CONC izabeth Kettle, Abigail Flint and Hannah Vickery, 5s. each. To the chi

2 CONT William Warner of the City of London, sailor aged 35. (Vol. 41).(??)
2 CONT
2 CONT The first settler who "penetrated the wilds of Blockley"
2 CONT was William Warner, of Blockley, England. He was a
2 CONT resident as early as 1677, having arrived before the great
2 CONT influx of either Welsh or English colonists. William
2 CONT Warner built his house on what afterwards was Forty-fifth
2 CONT and Westminster Avenue. He named his plantation
2 CONT "Blockley" after his home in England.
2 CONT
2 CONT He landed at Upland,
2 CONT now Chester. His title was confirmed by William Penn.
2 CONT John Warner, a brother of William, soon followed
2 CONT him, coming over with Penn, and settled nearby. Both
2 CONT were members of the first Pennsylvania Legislature.
2 CONT
2 CONT The name of Duckett, Warner, Kite and others, all
2 CONT early members of the Schuylkill Friends' Meeting, appear
2 CONT on the records at the Friends' Meeting House, Fifteenth
2 CONT and Race Streets, Philadelphia. Mary Warner, daughter
2 CONT of William Warner, married Thomas W'ynn, grandson of
2 CONT Dr. Thomas Wynne.

2 CONT FATHER: William and Anne (Dyde) Warner were Puritans while
2 CONT in England. After coming to America and associating with

2 CONT married into that sect, although there is no evidence that Wil-
2 CONT liam and Anne ever belonged to any of their meetings.
2 CONT Anne (Dyde) \Varner survived her husband. By his will
2 CONT he divided his lands between his sons, John and Isaac, and his
2 CONT deceased daughter's husband, James Kite and his children.
2 CONT His son, William, was provided for by other means. To his
2 CONT son, Robert, in England, he gave his estate at Draycott, \Vor-
2 CONT cestershire, England. His estate “Blockley” went to his widow
2 CONT and son, Isaac. '

2 CONT helped in the settlement of new Sweden in America.
2 CONT  William and Christian \Varner had four children, namely,
2 CONT Swen, Isaac, Hannah, and Jacob. \Villiam lived in Glou-
2 CONT ster Co., N. J., where he died in 1714.
