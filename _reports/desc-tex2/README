                  (don't change this file; change mysetup.tex)
drtree.tex    -> modified tree macros for desc-tex2 
ex1.tex       -> an example showing how to merge two or more
                 trees ``by hand'' and using invisible nodes.

How to make it work ?

  - call the desc-tex2 report from Lifelines
  - answer the questions
  - generate a file <something>.tex
  - apply TeX (not LaTeX) to this file
  - preview it with xdvi or an other previewer
  - generate PostScript with dvips
