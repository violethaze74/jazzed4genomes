From 1682 to 1776 the province of Pennsylvania was the objective point of emigration fromGermany, France and Switzerland. As early as 1727 the Provincial Council of Pennsylvania passed a resolution that the masters of the vessels importing Germans and others from Europe shall be examined whether they have permission to carry these people; that a list be taken of theemigrants, the place from which they came, their occupation and theirreason for coming to America. Our immigrant Johann Casper Hepler was born July 10, 1713 and his wife Susanna Scheible December 18, 1718. :: A writing was drawn up which each emigrant must sign in his own handwriting declaring allegiance and subjection to the king of Great Britain and fidelity to the Proprietary of the Province. These ship lists are published in the &quot;Colonial Records&quot; and &quot;Rupps Immigrants&quot; and theoriginals are preserved in the Library at Harrisburg. :: It was early in 1748 when the Hoepplers - Casper, Susanna and theirfirst born Jacob,and baby Christopher set sail on the ship Patience (John Browne, Master) from Rotterdam, Holland, for the New World. The passenger list of this boat shows Casper Hepler (Hoeppler) was the seventeenth person to sign the usual forms at Philadelphia Court House, onSeptember 16, 1748. :: Although documentation is lacking to connect the above immigrant with the early settler, the family historian relates that Upper Milford Township in Northampton County was his destination. This is approximately 30 miles north of Philadelphia, in the southern part of present day Lehigh County, ten miles south of Allentown. The area is described: :: The soils of the Milfords is very productive and is well cultivated, which is the chief employment of the inhabitants. The Milfords are well-watered with the best and most wholesome water found in the LehighCounty or any county in Pennsylvania. The surface formation is very irregular, mountainous and hilly. In the southern part of Lower Milfordis the Hosensack Hill or the great Mill Hill, commonly called &quot;der Crosse Muehlberg&quot;. Although there are many acres of land untillable in the Milfords, these hills furnish fuel and timber... and are a great protection from destructive storms. :: The decision to settle here was unlikely based on proximity to market, since Philadelphia was a two-day wagon journey away. Availability of land was an important factor; since this was still frontier, property was obtainable, and 115 acres was claimed. The German language predominance and the Lutheran religion established would be additional conditons favoring settlement in then Northampton County, an area of largely German inhabitants, thus lessening the cultural shock. : : Church3 small: Dillingersville Union School &amp; Church. Casper and his family were members of this church. It was built as a church &amp; school. :: As in many early communities, the local church was a significant binding element, and it is from the records of the Evangelical Lutheran Congregation of Upper Milford (near Dillingersville) that the progressof the Hepler family is traced. The church was started about 1744. The church was abandoned about 1791. Member from this church formed the nucleus of the Lutheran Church at Zionsville. :: In 1757 a new congregation was organized at the Second Upper Milford Lutheran Congregation. This is the church at Old Zionsville and the present church is a stately old edifice with a beautifully kept cemetery. While Casper is not mentioned as one of the organizers, we find that he and his sons, Jacob and Christopher were communicants in 1765. The Reformed Church was also built in 1757. The church record book started at this time. The early history of the churches at Zionsville is somewhat confusing, but apparently there were separate Lutheran &amp; Reformed church buildings from the beginning,said to have been log structures until 1818. At that time the building had become old &amp; unsatisfactory &amp; the Lutheran congregation decided to erect a new church. A numberof the Reformed families then left the Reformed congregation &amp; joinedthe Lutherans in erecting a Union Church. The arrangement continued until 1871 at which time the Reformed members sold their interest inthebuilding &amp; rejoined the original Reformed Church. :: The genealogist in looking up baptisms at Zionsville must thereforeremember 4 places to examine records. Dillingersville and Zionsville Lutheran Church records, Reformed that separated itself &amp; the originalReformed record itself. :: The church records document at communion services, and the 1754, 1755, 1766, and 1757 rosters show Casper and Susanna Hepler (spelled Hopfeler, Hepper, Heppeler or Hoebler) present. One newborn son is mentioned---Michael Hepler (spelled Hoppler), born January 2, 1757 and baptized March 6, 1757, sponsored by Michael Scheibele and wife Barbara. Although Casper Hepler's name is listed in 1758 and 1760, the name of Susanna Hepler is no longer found after 1757 and it is presumed she diedabout this time. :: This era of six years peace and plenty was rudely broken when in 1755 General Braddock was defeated by the French and Indians in Western Pennsylvania. The red man was immediately appeared in small groups in different sections of the settlements and began a murderous warfare against the unsuspecting settlers. A report in 12-11-1755 states that 200 hostile Indians were roaming about the plantations killing settlers,and burning down their houses. Such were the trials, tribulations anddangers the first families of settlers experienced in the new land, and in the midst of them was Casper Hepler with his growing family, nowconsisting of his wife and four children, Jacob, Christopher, Casper and George. :: In 1758 Susanna Hepler no longer appears. Se probably died about this time and Casper re-married about 1762 to Anna Mary who survived him, and is mentioned in his will. :: The hardships of twenty years pioneer life told on Casper Hepler and on April 29, 1769, he made his last will and testament. When he diedis not known but the will was probated August 1, 1769, at Easton, Pa.He was only fifty-seven years old. His estate was left to his wife Anna Mary as long as she remained his widow: at her death to his sons; Jacob, two fifths, Christopher, Casper Jr. and George, each one-fifth. He also willed to the overseers of the Lutheran Church of Upper Milford, presumably the church at Zionsville- twenty shillings, which gives us a good idea of his character and integrity. Twenty shillings seems a small sum now, but then 300 acres of land could be bought for that sum. His burial place, though urgently sought, has never been found butit is most likely at Zionsville. All the old stones have been removedas they were illegible. :: Casper Hepler was a weaver of cloth and worked at his trade. His farm which he acquired in 1753 was farmed by Michael Scheible, probably his brother-in-law. Anna Mary died about 1771. for it was then that the Venue of personal property was held and final account filed. :: Jacob the oldest son sold his two-fifth portion of the home farm tohis brother Christopher, who in turn sold his share and the two shares he bought from brother Jacob to Casper. Jacob bought land in LuzerneCounty. Later Jacob relocated to Armstrong County, Pa. The youngest brother George sold his one-fifth to Casper and established a home in Whitehall Township. Christopher settled in North Carolina. : : THE WAR OF THE REVOLUTION :: In 1775 Old Man Mars again looms up in the shape of Great Britain in its last and final efforts to subdue the spirits of the colonists. At once the four sons of Casper: Jacob, Christopher, Casper Jr. &amp; George left their families of very young children to fight for their freedom against the British. :: Jacob at once joined the regiment under Colonel Seigfried at Bethlehem, Pa. This outfit was part of General Israel Putman's Brigade, the man who made famous the saying &quot;Don't shoot till you see the whites oftheir eyes&quot;. Casper joined Colonel Kooken's Company, Second Battalion, Northampton County, Pa. and George Hepler in the Sixth Battalion,under Captain Jacob Peterman. :: Again in the Militia Rolls of 1785 appear the names of Casper Hepler, Jacob Hepler and Stoffel Hepler. :: Following the war Jacob sold his two-fifth portion to his brother Christopher, and bought land in Luzerne County. He lived there for sometime, later moving and buying a farm in Armstrong County, Pa. There are thousands of Heplers living there today. :: In 1785 Christopher sold out his portion of the farm to Casper Jr. Christopher took his young family and moved to North Carolina and settled in what was then Rowan County, now Davies.
