The Merricks had seven children. Charlotte, the eldest, was born in 1791 and married Elisha Collar of Merrickville; William Jr, my ancestor, was born on March 28, 1793, and married Judith Roche the William Roche Merrick &amp; wife Jane c 1870 daughter of William and Ann Roche of County Cork Ireland; .

He acquired a sawmill from Rogers Stephens on the Rideau River in 1793.
