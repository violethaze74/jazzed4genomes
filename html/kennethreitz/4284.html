His place of origin is established by a record showing the enrollment for passage to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', under a minister's certification dated March 14, 1634/5, of &quot;Thos Hayward of Aylesford in Kent Taylor &amp; Susanna his Wief&quot; and children &quot;Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan, and Martha.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boys751&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Date and Place of Birth ===Thomas's date and place of birth are uncertain. Many family trees state that Thomas was born in Aylesford, Kent. Since (as established by the ''Hercules'' passenger list referenced in &quot;Origin&quot; above) Thomas was living in Aylesford before he emigrated, it is reasonably plausible that he was born there. However, no record of his birth or baptism hasbeen found. If Thomas was born and baptized in Aylesford, it is unlikely that any record of his birth or baptism will ever be found, as no records appear to exist for Aylesford, Saints Peter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aylesford&quot;/&gt; Based on his estimated date of marriage (sometime in 1620-1628), Thomas was probably born sometime in 1595-1607. Anderson estimated his date of birth as &quot;by about 1599,&quot; based on an estimated date of marriage of &quot;by about 1624.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; An estimate of &quot;about 1600&quot; seems better, however, given his 1595-1607 estimated birth range and the false precision suggested by &quot;about 1599.&quot; === Parentage ===Thomas's parentage has not been established. A number of unsourced family trees claim that Thomas was the son of a Thomas Hayward and an Agnes (Beaumon) Hayward of Aylesford, Kent. However, no reliable source has been found for that parentage or even their existence. === Marriage ===The ''Hercules'' passenger list referenced in &quot;Origin&quot; above establishes that Thomas was married to a woman named Susanna.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; As discussed in [[Towne-491|her profile]], Susanna's maiden name may have been Towne, but that is uncertain. Thomas and Susanna's date and place of marriage are uncertain. Since the ''Hercules'' passenger list establishes that Thomas and Susanna were residents of Aylesford, Kent, it is reasonably likely that they were married there or in a nearby parish. If they were married in Aylesford, it is unlikely that any marriage record will ever be found, since,as discussed above, no records appear to exist for Aylesford, Saints Peter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aylesford&quot;/&gt; Based on the fact that the ''Hercules'' passenger list shows that Thomas and Susanna had 5 children as of March 1634/5, and assuming the first child was born 1 year after their marriage and assuming a 2-year gap between births, one derives an estimated marriage date of sometime in 1624-1627. Based on the possibility of miscarriages, still births, children who died young, and longer gaps between births, they could well have been married as early as, say, 1620. Based on the possibility of twins or shorter gaps between births, they could have been married as late as 1628. Anderson estimates that they were married &quot;by about 1624,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; although this suggests that 1624 was the later end of the possible range when, instead, it appears to be a reasonable midpoint. === Emigration to New England ===As discussed above under &quot;Origin,&quot; Thomas, his wife Susanna and his five eldest children, Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan and Martha, emigrated to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', which departed Sandwich, England for New England in March 1634/5.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boys751&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; The passenger list for the ''William &amp; Francis'', which embarked at London on March 7, 1631/2 and arrived in Boston on June 5, 1632, included a &quot;Thomas Haeward.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hotten149&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GMB2p900&quot;/&gt; Savage suggested that this record might also relate to this profile's Thomas Hayward and might show that Thomas first came to New England withWinslow in 1632 and, satisfied with the prospects, went home to bringhis family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p394&quot;/&gt; Anderson found no evidence either for or against this proposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;GMB2p900&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; === Residency at Cambridge; First Record in New England ===Thomas and his family appear to have initially settled in Cambridge in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; The first known record of Thomas in New England is the grant to him on January 4, 1635 by the town of Cambridge of &quot;about 2 Acks wthin wstend ffeild gate beyond the Clay pits.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CaTR15&quot;/&gt; No further records have been found of Thomas or his family in Cambridge. === Residency at Duxbury and Bridgewater ===Thomas appears to have moved from Cambridge to Duxbury in the Plymouth Colony by 1638. The first record of Thomas at Duxbury is a grant to him by the Plymouth Colony Court of Assistant held on November 5, 1638of 10 acres of land &quot;lying on the Duxborrow side.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR1p101&quot;/&gt; He received additional grants of land in Duxbury in 1640.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR1p144&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR1p161&quot;/&gt; Thomas was admitted as a Freeman in 1647&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR2p114&quot;/&gt; and was chosen as constable of Duxbury in 1648.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR2p123&quot;/&gt; Thomas was one of the original proprietors of the Duxborrow new plantation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell10-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell26&quot;/&gt; which was incorporated as the town of Bridgewater in 1656.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR3p101&quot;/&gt; By 1658, Thomas was living in Bridgewater.

The will of Peter Towne includes a bequest to his &quot;first cousins at Bridgewater&quot; Nathaniel Howard, Joseph Howard, Elisha Howard and Mary Mitchell,&lt;ref name=&quot;PeterWill&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR20p370&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM7p78&quot;/&gt; who were children of [[Hayward-270|Thomas Hayward]] and his wife Susanna.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM7p78&quot;/&gt; Some genealogists seem to have concluded that this means that Susanna, the wife of Thomas Hayward, was William Towne's sister. Foremost among these was Clarence Almon Torrey.In his 1945 TAG article ''Some Ancestral Lines of President William Howard Taft'', he stated (without sources or discussion) that Thomas Hayward married Susanna Towne.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAG22p205&quot;/&gt; In addition, the entry for Thomas Hayward's marriage in Torrey's ''New England Marriagesto 1700'' has Susanna's maiden name of &quot;[Towne]&quot; in brackets but without a question mark, indicating that, although no marriage record had been found, Torrey was confident that her maiden name was Towne. None of the sources listed by Torrey, however, provide any useful evidence for Susanna's last name beyond the language of Peter Towne's will and none, except Torrey's own 1945 TAG article and one source that explicitly relied on it, claim that her maiden name was Towne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Torreys&quot;/&gt; It is unclear why Torrey felt confident that Susanna's maiden name was Towne, as there are three (seemingly equally probable) ways inwhich Thomas and Susanna Hayward's children could have been Peter Towne's cousins:# Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna could have been the sister of WilliamTowne. In that case, Susanna's maiden name would have been Towne and the maiden name of William's wife Martha would be unknown.# Thomas Hayward could have been the sister of William Town's wife Martha. In that case, Martha's maiden name would have been Hayward and the maiden name of Thomas's wife Susanna would be unknown.# Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna could have been the sister of WilliamTowne's wife Martha. In that case, the maiden name of both Susanna and Martha would be unknown.No evidence has been found that favors one of these possibilities over another. Anderson declined to adopt Torrey's theory that the maiden name of Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna was Towne and instead concluded that the relationship between the children of Thomas and Susanna Hayward and Peter Towne has not been determined.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM7p78&quot;/&gt; === Maiden Name; Parentage ===Susanna's maiden name is uncertain. As discussed above under &quot;Relationship to William and Peter Towne,&quot; it is quite possible that she was the sister of William Towne and thus her maiden name was Towne. However, it is also quite possible, if not probable, that she was not the sister of William Towne, in which case, there would be no reason to thinkthat her maiden name was Towne and her maiden name is unknown. Even if she was William Towne's sister, her parentage would be unknown, since, as discussed in [[Towne-493|William's profile]], his parentage is unknown. === Origin ===The origin (last residence prior to emigrating to New England) of Susanna, the wife of Thomas Hayward of Duxbury and Bridgewater, was Aylesford, Kent. Her place of origin is established by a record showing theenrollment for passage to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', under a minister's certification dated March 14, 1634/5, of &quot;Thos Hayward ofAylesford in Kent Taylor &amp; Susanna his Wief&quot; and children &quot;Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan, and Martha.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boys751&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Date and Place of Birth ===Susanna's date and place of birth are uncertain. Many family trees state that Susanna was born in Aylesford, Kent. Since (as established bythe ''Hercules'' passenger list referenced in &quot;Origin&quot; above) Susannawas living in Aylesford before she emigrated, it is reasonably plausible that she was born there. However, no record of her birth or baptism has been found. If Susanna was born and baptized in Aylesford, it isunlikely that any record of her birth or baptism will ever be found, as no records appear to exist for Aylesford, Saints Peter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aylesford&quot;/&gt; Based on her estimated date of marriage (sometime in 1620-1628), Susanna was probably born sometime in 1595-1610, with &quot;about 1602&quot; as a reasonable midpoint estimate. === Marriage ===Susanna and Thomas Hayward's date and place of marriage are uncertain. Since the ''Hercules'' passenger list establishes that Susanna and Thomas were residents of Aylesford, Kent, it is reasonably likely that they were married there or in a nearby parish. If they were married inAylesford, it is unlikely that any marriage record will ever be found, since, as discussed above, no records appear to exist for Aylesford,Saints Peter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aylesford&quot;/&gt; Based on the fact that the ''Hercules'' passenger list shows that Susanna and Thomas had 5 children as of March 1634/5, and assuming the first child was born 1 year after their marriage and assuming a 2-year gap between births, one derives an estimated marriage date of sometime in 1624-1627. Based on the possibility of miscarriages, still births, children who died young, and longer gaps between births, they could well have been married as early as, say, 1620. Based on the possibility of twins or shorter gaps between births, they could have been married as late as 1628. Anderson estimates that they were married &quot;by about 1624,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; although this suggests that 1624 was the later end of the possible range when, instead, it appears to be a reasonable midpoint. === Emigration to New England ===As discussed above under &quot;Origin,&quot; Susanna, her husband Thomas, and their five eldest children, Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan and Martha, emigrated to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', which departed Sandwich, England for New England in March 1634/5.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boys751&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Residency at Cambridge, Duxbury and Bridgewater ===As discussed in the profile for her husband, [[Hayward-270|Thomas Hayward]], Susanna and her family appear to have initially settled in Cambridge in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, moved to Duxbury in the Plymouth Colony by 1638, and finally moved to Bridgewater by 1658. === Children === Susanna and Thomas had the following children:# [[Hayward-130|Thomas]], b. in England perhaps about 1624,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; m. Sarah _______,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; d.s.p. before April17, 1699&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p293&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-172|John]], b. in England perhaps about 1626,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; m. by 1661 Sarah Mitchell.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; Commonly called John of the Plain to distinguish him from John Haward/Howard, the husband of his sister Martha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell177&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-1132|Elizabeth]], b. in England perhaps about 1628,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; m.

A 1954 article in TAG concluded that, contrary to the assertion in ''DunhamGenealogy'', Daniel Dunham's wife was named Hannah and that her maiden name was undetermined.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAG30p146&quot;/&gt; === Death ===Susanna's date and place of death are uncertain. No record that establishes her death has been found. Based on the fact that she was not mentioned in her husband's will which he made on June 29, 1678,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCW4p82&quot;/&gt; she presumably died before that date. Since she and her husband were residents of Bridgewater, she presumably died there. &lt;span class=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;PCW4p82&quot;&gt;Plymouth Colony Records, Wills, Vol. 4 1683-1686, Part 1, p 82.

Kent, -- with wife Susanna, and five children.  But he had, perhaps, been here as early as 1632, coming withWinslow, in the William and Francis, and, satisfied with prospects, went home to bring them.  Settled in Duxbury, 1638; probably at Bridgewater, 1651, being of the first proprietors, 1645; was freeman of the colony, 1646.  Had Thomas, Nathaniel, John, Joseph, Elisha, Mary, wife of Edward Mitchell, and Martha, wife of John Howard.  But of these, weare unable to discriminate which were born in England, or whether even he were that Kentish man or not.  He died 1681. == Biography == From History of Bridgewater:Thomas Esq. (son of Thomas Hayward I) was also one of the first settlers of Bridgewater, and by far the most honored and distinguished man in the place; was one of the first military officers; appointed Lieutenant 1667 and Captain 1692; was a Magistrate and one of the Governor'sAssistants, first chosen 1690, and Justice of C.C.P. and Sessions 1692; his death was occasioned by a fall from his horse, 15 Aug. 1698; heleft a wid. Sarah, but no children, he lived near where Daniel Hayward now lives. The first military officers were Josiah Standish, Lieutenant, 1660, who soon after returned to Duxbury; and Thomas Hayward, Jr., Lieutenant; and John Haward, Ensign, appointed 1664.   And in 1689 they were promoted, and Samuel Packard appointed Ensign.—Deacon John Willis was appointed to administer oaths, &amp;c., in 1660, but Capt. Thomas Hayward, Jr., was the first Magistrate in town, and one of the Governor's Council or Assistants 1690, and also a Judge of the courts; he was killed by a fall from his horse, August 15, 1698, while on a journey to Marshfield on business.—Elihu Brett was the next Magistrate, and he was also appointed a Judge of the courts 1700; he died suddenly in his chairJanuary 12th, 1712. Phillips War:   The following is an extract from an ancient manuscript, of which Comfort Willis, who then held the office of &quot;Town Trooper,&quot; is supposedto have been the author:— &quot;On Saturday, Capt. (Thomas) Hayward, Sergeant (Samuel Jr.) Packard, John Willis, and Isaac Harris, went out to see if the Indians were coming down upon them, and they saw an Indian, which made them think the enemy was at hand; and they immediately pressed Comfort Willis and Joseph Edson to go post to the Governor the same day at night to tell him of it.   And he went to Plymouth with them the next day, to send Capt. Church with his company.   And Capt. Church came with them to Monponset on the Sabbath, and came no further that day; and he told them he would meet them the next day.   And Comfort Willis and Joseph Edsoncame home at night and told their friends of it, and Ensign (John) Haward, Samuel Edson, Josiah Edson, Joseph Edson, John Washburn, Samuel Washburn, Thomas Washburn, John Field, Nicholas Byram, Samuel Allen, Samuel Allen, Jr., John Gordon, John Hayward, John Packard, John Ames, Comfort Willis, Guido Bailey, Nathaniel Hayward, John Whitman, John Packard and Samuel Leach went out on Monday, supposing to meet with Captain Church; but they came upon the enemy, and fought with them, and took seventeen of them alive and also much plunder.   And they all returned, and not one of them fell by the enemy, and received no help from Church.&quot; wikipedia:King Philip's War, sometimes called the First Indian War, Metacom's War, Metacomet's War, or Metacom's Rebellion, was an armed conflict between Native American inhabitants of present-day New England and English colonists and their Native American allies in 1675–78. The war is named after the main leader of the Native American side, Metacomet, known to the English as &quot;King Philip&quot;. Major Benjamin Church emerged as the Puritan hero of the war; it was his company of Puritan rangers andNative American allies that finally hunted down and killed King Philip on August 12, 1676. The war continued in northern New England (primarily in Maine at the New England and Acadia border) until a treaty wassigned at Casco Bay in April 1678.The war was the single greatest calamity to occur in seventeenth-century Puritan New England. In the space of little more than a year, twelve of the region's towns were destroyed and many more damaged, the colony's economy was all but ruined, and much of its population was killed, including one-tenth of all men available for military service. Morethan half of New England's towns were attacked by Native American warriors. NY Times:.....King Philip's War (or Metacom's Rebellion, for those who prefer the actual name of the Wampanoag chief). That fearsome and formative confrontation between white settlers and the New England tribes remains, per capita, America's deadliest war. In one year, one of every 10 white men of military age in Massachusetts Bay was killed, and one of every 16 in the Northeastern colonies. Two-thirds of New England towns were attacked and more than half the settlements were left in ruins. Settlers were forced to retreat nearly to the coast, and the Colonial economy was devastated.<br/><span id='n4'>4.</span> [[Category:US President Direct Ancestor]] [[Category: Bridgewater, Massachusetts]] {{Puritan Great Migration|needs=Research|needs1=Biography}} ----'''TAKE CARE...'''

Anderson estimates that she was born &quot;say 1635,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; apparently based on the date he estimated for her parents' marriage and for her siblings' dates of birth. However, since all those dates seem to be rough estimates and the window for her birth in 1635 is very small, it is very possible (if not likely) that Martha wasborn somewhat earlier.  Since the ''Hercules'' passenger lists statesthat Thomas and his family were from Aylesford, England, Martha was very probably born there.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Emigration to New England ===Martha and her family sailed from Sandwich, England to New England in1635 aboard the ship ''Hercules'', John Witherley, master.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hotten&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; They settled first at Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Removal to Duxbury ===Martha's family moved from Cambridge to Duxbury by 1638.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p289&quot;/&gt; === &quot;Vain, Light and Lascivious Carriage&quot; ===At a Grand Inquest on June 8, 1651, Martha Haward of Duxbury, along with John Shaw, James Shaw, Samuel Cutbert and Benjamin Eaton of Plymouth and Goodwife Gannett and William Snow of Duxbury, were presented for &quot;vaine, light and lacivius carriage at an unseasonable time of night.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR2p170&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; At the General Court at New Plymouth on October 7, 1651, the Court, &quot;not finding them alike faulty, have fined James Shaw and Goodwife Ganett thirty shillings apeace . . . and Samuell Cutbert, William Snow, Benjamine Eaton and Martha Haward are released, with admonishion to take heed of such evell carriages for the future. And as for John Shaw, he is lyable to punishment when oppertunitie serveth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR2p172&quot;/&gt; === Marriage ===Martha married John Haward/Howard.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; The first name of John Haward/Howard's wife is confirmed by records of the division of his estate, which refer to his widow Martha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard3-4&quot;/&gt; The identity of John Haward/Howard's wife as a daughter of ThomasHayward is confirmed by a quitclaim by John's children of rights to property bequeathed by Peter Town to Thomas Hayward's children.&lt;ref name=&quot;MiddlesexDeeds23p398&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p293&quot;/&gt; Some family trees state that Martha and John were married on April 6,1657 in Dennis, Barnstable County. However, both the date and location seem very improbable, and no reliable sources supporting either thatdate or location have been found. Based on the estimated dates of birth of their children, Martha and John were probably married sometime in 1652-1655. Consistent with this range, Anderson states that they were married &quot;by about 1655.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; Since both Thomas Hayward and John Haward/Howard were residents of Duxbury during that time period (and Bridgewater was not incorporated until 1656), they were probably married there. === Children === Martha and John had the following children:# [[Howard-704|John]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1653-7 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1678 Sara Latham,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard6&quot;/&gt; d. 1727 in Bridgewater&lt;ref name=&quot;BrocktonVR336&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-8985|Elizabeth]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1654-8 in Bridgewater&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1676 Edward Fobes&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-6598|Sarah]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1657-61 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1679 Zaccheus Packard&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-899|James]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1660-4 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1685 Elizabeth Washburn,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; d. 1690 on the Canada Expedition&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-994|Jonathan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1664-8 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1st January 8, 1688/9 Susanna Keith in Taunton,&lt;ref name=&quot;TauntonVR2p241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; m. 2d October 8, 1691 Sarah Dean in Taunton,&lt;ref name=&quot;TauntonVR2p241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; d. in or before 1739 (date estate divided)&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-991|Ephraim]], b. 1667 in Bridgewater, m. about 1688/9 Mary Keith in Bridgewater, d.

John Hayward of Bridgewater]], who was the brother-in-law of this profile's Lt. JohnHaward of Bridgewater.''' == Biography == === Name ===Original records for this profile's John Howard of Bridgewater consistently spell his name as &quot;Haward,&quot; with a few exceptions that spell his name &quot;Heyward,&quot; &quot;Hayward&quot; or &quot;Heward.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; No original record has been found that spells his name &quot;Howard&quot; during his lifetime, although Mitchell assures us that that is how his name was pronounced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; He was often referred to in the original records by his military title of &quot;Ensign&quot; subsequent to his appointment to that position in 1664 and as &quot;Lieutenant&quot; subsequent to his promotion to that position in 1689.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; He was also sometimes referred to in the original records as John Haward Senior in order to distinguish him from hisyounger brother-in-law, John Hayward/Haward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; (&quot;Senior&quot; was not needed to distinguish him from his son John at the timeSenior was used in the records, as his son was still quite young at the time of those records.) === Earliest Plymouth Records === The earliest Plymouth Colony records of a John Haward/Heyward are:* A June 7, 1637 list of names of soldiers willing to to assist the colonies of Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut in their wars against thePequin Indians, which includes the name &quot;John Heyward.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR1p61&quot;/&gt;* A record of a grant at a Plymouth town meeting on October 17, 1642 to &quot;John Heyward&quot; of a garden place next Andrew Ringe and 10 acres of upland at Fresh Lake by the fishing point.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR2p48&quot;/&gt;Curiously, none of the secondary sources for this profile's John Haward/Heyward mention those records. The first record of this profile's John Haward/Heyward mentioned in secondary sources is a 1643 list of names of males in Duxbury aged 16-60 able to bear arms, which includes the name &quot;John Heyward.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p190&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; There is some evidence that there might have been two John Heywards in the Plymouth Colony. The same 1643 list of names of males aged 16-60able to bear arms includes two John Heywards: one in Plymouth&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p188&quot;/&gt; and one in Duxbury. In addition, the 1657 record of mentaking the oath of fidelity in the Plymouth Colony includes two John Hawards: one in Plymouth&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p181&quot;/&gt; and one in Bridgewater.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p185&quot;/&gt; Assuming that the same person was not listed intwo towns, it thus seems likely that there was a John Heyward/Haward of Plymouth and a John Heyward/Haward of Duxbury/Bridgewater and that the 1637 and 1642 Plymouth Colony records for John Heyward relate to the former. === Parentage; Date and Place of Birth ===John's parentage is unknown, except perhaps for the first name of hismother. The &quot;Howard Genealogy&quot; contains a copy of a letter dated August 16, 1652 by a Mary Hayward in London to her son John Hayward in NewEngland that was in the possession of a member of the Howard family and was supposedly written to this profile's John Haward/Hayward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howardxvi&quot;/&gt; (An image purportedly of the original letter is attached to this profile.) Assuming that letter is authentic and relates to this profile's John Haward/Hayward, his mother's name was Mary and she was living in London in 1652. Some family trees say that John was the son of a James Howard/Haward and a Mary Cooper, but no reliable evidence for that parentage has been found. John's date of birth is uncertain. Assuming that the secondary sources are correct and that the first record of this profile's John Haward/Heyward is the 1643 list of males of Duxborrow 16-60 years old able tobear arms (and not the earlier Plymouth records for a &quot;John Heyward&quot;), John was probably born sometime in 1623-1627 based on (i) the fact that his inclusion in the 1643 list means that he was at least 16 in 1643 and thus born no later than 1627 and (ii) the fact that the earliest estimated date of birth of one of his children (1653) suggests that he was probably not older than 30 years old at that date and thus was probably born no earlier than 1623. If, on the other hand, the 1637 record for &quot;John Heyward&quot; relates to this profiles John Haward/Heyward, he was probably born no later than 1621 (since, to volunteer for military service, he probably needed to be at least 16 years old). John's place of birth is also uncertain. It is very likely that he was born in England.  Some family trees say that John was born in Sandwich, Kent, but no reliable evidence supporting that proposition has been found. Assuming the letter referred to above is authentic and relates to this profile's John Howard, it is quite possible that he was bornin London, since his mother was living there in 1652. === Immigration to New England ===John Haward's date of immigration is uncertain and his means of immigration are unknown. Based on the assumption that John was the &quot;John Heyward&quot; included in a 1643 list of men of Duxbury, Plymouth Colony 16-60 years old able to bear arms,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p190&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; he immigrated sometime before that date. === Age at Immigration; Brought up by Miles Standish? ===Based on John's estimated date of birth (1623-1627), John was still aminor when he immigrated. This is consistent with &quot;History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater,&quot; which states that John &quot;was young when he came over,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; and with  the &quot;Howard Genealogy&quot;, which states (without support) that John was about 15 when he immigrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; Secondary sources suggest that John arrived without his parents and lived, for a time, with Miles Standish, who resided in Duxbury. According to &quot;History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater,&quot; &quot;it is said, [that John] lived in Capt. Miles Standish's family,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; while Savage (writing after Mitchell) stated that John was &quot;one of the first sett. brot. up by Capt. Miles Standish.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt; === Brother James or George? ===According to &quot;History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater,&quot; John immigrated with a brother named James, who subsequently moved to Bermuda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; The &quot;Howard Genealogy,&quot; however, states that he immigrated with a brother named George.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; The source for &quot;George&quot; in the &quot;Howard Genealogy&quot; appears to be the letter referenced above by Mary Hayward to John Hayward in New England, which also references her son George Hayward and niece Sarah, also in New England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howardxvi&quot;/&gt; Some additional support for the proposition that John had a brother named George is provided by the fact that a &quot;Gorg Haward&quot; took the oath of fidelity in Barnstable, PlymouthColony in 1657,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p179&quot;/&gt; the same year that John took the oath in Bridgewater. If, as the evidence suggests, John and his brother James/George immigrated as teenagers without their parents, they may well have ended up in the care of different families, which would help explain why Georgeended up settling in Barnstable, while John settled in Duxbury and Bridgewater. ===  Residency in Duxbury; Removal to Bridgewater ===Based on the inclusion of the name of &quot;John Heyward&quot; in the 1643 listof names of males in Duxbury aged 16-60 able to bear arms,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p190&quot;/&gt; John was living in Duxbury at that date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; The town of Bridgewater started as a grant of additional land to the inhabitants of Duxbury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell9-13&quot;/&gt; John Haward was one of the original proprietors of the Duxborrow new plantation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell10-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; which supports the proposition that John Haward of Bridgewater was the same person as John Heyward of Duxbury. According to &quot;History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater&quot;and the &quot;Howard Genealogy,&quot; John moved to what would become Bridgewater about 1651.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; The Duxborrow new plantationwas incorporated as the town of Bridgewater in 1656.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR3p101&quot;/&gt; === Marriage ===John married [[Hayward-769|Martha Hayward]], daughter of Thomas Hayward.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; Her first name is confirmed by records of the division of his estate, which refer to his widow Martha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard3-4&quot;/&gt; Her identity as a daughter of Thomas Hayward is confirmed by a quitclaim by John's children of rights to property bequeathed by Peter Town to Thomas Hayward's children.&lt;ref name=&quot;MiddlesexDeeds23p398&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p293&quot;/&gt; Some family trees state that John and Martha were married on April 6,1657 in Dennis, Barnstable County. However, both the date and location seem very improbable, and no reliable sources supporting either thatdate or location have been found. Based on the estimated dates of birth of their children, John and Martha were probably married sometime in 1652-1655. Consistent with this range, Anderson states that they were married &quot;by about 1655.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; Since both John and Thomas Hayward were residents of Duxbury during that time period (and Bridgewater was not incorporated until 1656), they were probably marriedthere. === Children === John and Martha had the following children:# [[Howard-704|John]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1653-7 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1678 Sara Latham,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard6&quot;/&gt; d. 1727 in Bridgewater&lt;ref name=&quot;BrocktonVR336&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-8985|Elizabeth]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1654-8 in Bridgewater&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1676 Edward Fobes&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-6598|Sarah]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1657-61 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1679 Zaccheus Packard&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-899|James]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1660-4 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1685 Elizabeth Washburn,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; d. 1690 on the Canada Expedition&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-994|Jonathan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1664-8 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1st January 8, 1688/9 Susanna Keith in Taunton,&lt;ref name=&quot;TauntonVR2p241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; m. 2d October 8, 1691 Sarah Dean in Taunton,&lt;ref name=&quot;TauntonVR2p241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; d. in or before 1739 (date estate divided)&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-991|Ephraim]], b. 1667 in Bridgewater, m. about 1688/9 Mary Keith in Bridgewater, d.

John was selected for a number of public offices by the town of Bridgewater, including as a surveyor of the highways in 1657 and 1671,  a selectman of the town of Bridgewater in 1678 and 1690, and a deputy to the Plymouth General Court in 1678 and 1683.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; John was also a leading officer in the Bridgewater town militia. He was appointed as Ensign of the militia in 1664.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; In1676, during King Phillip's War, he led a force of 21 townsmen, whichcame upon the enemy, fought with them, and took seventeen of them alive and also much plunder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; John was promoted to Lieutenant of the town militia in 1689&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; and was referred to as Lieut. John Haward in the records relating to his estate.&lt;ref&gt;See sources cited with respect to the administration and distribution of his estate in &quot;Death; Estate&quot; in this profile.&lt;/ref&gt; === Death; Estate ===NEHGR's 1911 ''Vital Records of Brockton'' states that John died in 1700, based on a gravestone record at North End and Ashland Cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrocktonVR336&quot;/&gt; The 1903 ''Howard Genealogy'' also states that he died in 1700, but provides no source&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard2&quot;/&gt; other than perhaps a plaque installed by his descendants on the Bridgewater Historical Society Building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howardxv&quot;/&gt; Mitchell, in his 1840 ''History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater'' apparently foundno record that established the year of his death and simply stated that he died &quot;about 1700.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; It appears reasonably likely that John actually died sometime in 1701rather than in 1700. The inventory of his estate was taken by Thomas Snell, Edward Mitchell and Joseph Hayward on September 24, 1701.&lt;ref name=&quot;EstatePapers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MD49p156-7&quot;/&gt; Since it was customary for the inventory to be taken within a month or so after the deceased's death, the date of his estate inventory suggests that John died in 1701. The inventory of John's estate included his house and homelands, about 400 additional acres of land, two servants, and over £112 owed to him in debts. The estate totaled more than £661, which was a very substantial sum for that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;EstatePapers&quot;/&gt; John died intestate.&lt;ref name=&quot;EstatePapers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard3&quot;/&gt; On October 16, 1701, Letters of Administration were granted to MarthaHaward (his widow) and John Haward (his eldest son),&lt;ref name=&quot;EstatePapers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MD49p156-7&quot;/&gt; they made oath as to the inventory,&lt;ref name=&quot;EstatePapers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MD49p156-7&quot;/&gt; and they agreed to adivision of the estate with his heirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MD49p156-7&quot;/&gt; The division of the estate made allocations to: his widow Martha; eldest son John Haward; second surviving son Jonathan Haward; youngest son Ephraim Haward; James Haward, the only son of deceasedson James Haward, and his two sisters; Edward Fobes and his wife Elizabeth; Zacheus Packard and his wife Sarah; and Henry Kingman and his wife Bethiah.

James Keith (then 45), was initially opposed to Ephraim marrying his daughter: :[Mary Keith] was courted by Ephraim Howard, not much to the acceptance of the old minister. Notwithstanding his objection, they were secretly married, and were pursued by the irate father. Arriving too late to prevent their marriage, he returned, and, complying with the prevailing custom, preached the following Sabbath from Hosea 4:17- &quot;Ephraim is joined to idols let him alone.&quot; Time, however, softened his spirit, and the reconciliation which followed inclined him to preach from Jeremiah 31:20 - &quot;Is Ephraim my dear son? Is he a pleasant child?
