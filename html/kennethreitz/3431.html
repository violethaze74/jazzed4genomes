Descendants of William And Ann(Dyde) Warner, 1627-1954. [Xenia, Ohio: s.n.], 1954. http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89062513130;view=1up;seq=18&lt;/ref&gt; FATHER: William and Anne (Dyde) Warner were Puritans while in England. After coming to America and associating with members of the Society of Friends, most of their children married into that sect, although there is no evidence that Wil- liam and Anne ever belonged to any of their meetings. Anne (Dyde) \Varner survived her husband. By his will he divided his lands between his sons, John and Isaac, and his deceased daughter's husband, James Kite and his children. His son, William, was provided for by other means. To his son, Robert, in England, he gave his estate at Draycott, \Vor- cestershire, England. His estate “Blockley” went to his widow and son, Isaac.
