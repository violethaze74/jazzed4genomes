John Merrick, born about 1546; nephew of Rt. Rev. Roland Merrick, Bishop of Bangor. Rev. William was at Llanleschid, where he may have been born. Upon the death of his uncle, Bishop of Bangor, Roland, he was transferred to another living, in the south, i.e., to Morfil, in Pembrokeshire. He was Rector of St. Davids, a little fishing village on St. Bride's Bay, in the extreme southwest part of Wales, at the western end, or mouth, of Bristol Channel. &quot;Morfil,&quot; in Welsh, signifies &quot;Whale,&quot; which is indicative of the occupation of the inhabitants of St. Davids, who depended very largely upon the fishing for their subsistence. &lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#SM]126]  Page:101&lt;/ref&gt; == Sources == &lt;references /&gt; * Source: &lt;span id='S129'&gt;S129&lt;/span&gt; Title:  Consolidated Library ofCape Cod History and Genealogy, Series: series - over 120 published Abbreviation:  Library of Cape Cod Author:  Smith, Leonard H.
