(1) It appears during his imprisonment, his wife was allowed “go forward” with some of her property and family perhaps as far as Lunenburg, Ontario (Stormont Township, near Cornwall). Following the peace settlement in 1783, Ephraim escaped prison or was released and he headed north to Canada arriving to join his wife in 1784 at Stormont which at the time was a “staging area” for new United Empire Loyalists awaiting receipt of land claims and entitlements. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merrickvillehistory.org/newsletters/newsletter-6-2.html Sylvia Comstock Merrick]&lt;/ref&gt; Ephraim Eyres, inasmuch as all the children claimed on him as the stepfather. He was an integral part of the spy network established by George Smyth, father of Thomas Smyth, who married Lavinia Comstock. And by the way, I found the marriage record in the Canadian Archives in theMerrick fonds for this couple, as [[Comstock-352|Sylvia Merrick]] wasa witness to the wedding, which occurred in Canada == Sources == &lt;references/&gt; *http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Info/detail.php?letter=e&amp;line=155*http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Info/extras/Eyres-Ephraim/Eyres-Ephraim-biography.php == Acknowledgments == Thanks to [[Merrick-236|Jackie Merrick]] for starting this profile.
