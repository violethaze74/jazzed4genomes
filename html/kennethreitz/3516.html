The will of Peter Towne includes a bequest to his &quot;first cousins at Bridgewater&quot; Nathaniel Howard, Joseph Howard, Elisha Howard and Mary Mitchell,&lt;ref name=&quot;PeterWill&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR20p370&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM7p78&quot;/&gt; who were children of [[Hayward-270|Thomas Hayward]] and his wife Susanna.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM7p78&quot;/&gt; Some genealogists seem to have concluded that this means that Susanna, the wife of Thomas Hayward, was William Towne's sister. Foremost among these was Clarence Almon Torrey.In his 1945 TAG article ''Some Ancestral Lines of President William Howard Taft'', he stated (without sources or discussion) that Thomas Hayward married Susanna Towne.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAG22p205&quot;/&gt; In addition, the entry for Thomas Hayward's marriage in Torrey's ''New England Marriagesto 1700'' has Susanna's maiden name of &quot;[Towne]&quot; in brackets but without a question mark, indicating that, although no marriage record had been found, Torrey was confident that her maiden name was Towne. None of the sources listed by Torrey, however, provide any useful evidence for Susanna's last name beyond the language of Peter Towne's will and none, except Torrey's own 1945 TAG article and one source that explicitly relied on it, claim that her maiden name was Towne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Torreys&quot;/&gt; It is unclear why Torrey felt confident that Susanna's maiden name was Towne, as there are three (seemingly equally probable) ways inwhich Thomas and Susanna Hayward's children could have been Peter Towne's cousins:# Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna could have been the sister of WilliamTowne. In that case, Susanna's maiden name would have been Towne and the maiden name of William's wife Martha would be unknown.# Thomas Hayward could have been the sister of William Town's wife Martha. In that case, Martha's maiden name would have been Hayward and the maiden name of Thomas's wife Susanna would be unknown.# Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna could have been the sister of WilliamTowne's wife Martha. In that case, the maiden name of both Susanna and Martha would be unknown.No evidence has been found that favors one of these possibilities over another. Anderson declined to adopt Torrey's theory that the maiden name of Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna was Towne and instead concluded that the relationship between the children of Thomas and Susanna Hayward and Peter Towne has not been determined.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM7p78&quot;/&gt; === Maiden Name; Parentage ===Susanna's maiden name is uncertain. As discussed above under &quot;Relationship to William and Peter Towne,&quot; it is quite possible that she was the sister of William Towne and thus her maiden name was Towne. However, it is also quite possible, if not probable, that she was not the sister of William Towne, in which case, there would be no reason to thinkthat her maiden name was Towne and her maiden name is unknown. Even if she was William Towne's sister, her parentage would be unknown, since, as discussed in [[Towne-493|William's profile]], his parentage is unknown. === Origin ===The origin (last residence prior to emigrating to New England) of Susanna, the wife of Thomas Hayward of Duxbury and Bridgewater, was Aylesford, Kent. Her place of origin is established by a record showing theenrollment for passage to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', under a minister's certification dated March 14, 1634/5, of &quot;Thos Hayward ofAylesford in Kent Taylor &amp; Susanna his Wief&quot; and children &quot;Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan, and Martha.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boys751&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Date and Place of Birth ===Susanna's date and place of birth are uncertain. Many family trees state that Susanna was born in Aylesford, Kent. Since (as established bythe ''Hercules'' passenger list referenced in &quot;Origin&quot; above) Susannawas living in Aylesford before she emigrated, it is reasonably plausible that she was born there. However, no record of her birth or baptism has been found. If Susanna was born and baptized in Aylesford, it isunlikely that any record of her birth or baptism will ever be found, as no records appear to exist for Aylesford, Saints Peter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aylesford&quot;/&gt; Based on her estimated date of marriage (sometime in 1620-1628), Susanna was probably born sometime in 1595-1610, with &quot;about 1602&quot; as a reasonable midpoint estimate. === Marriage ===Susanna and Thomas Hayward's date and place of marriage are uncertain. Since the ''Hercules'' passenger list establishes that Susanna and Thomas were residents of Aylesford, Kent, it is reasonably likely that they were married there or in a nearby parish. If they were married inAylesford, it is unlikely that any marriage record will ever be found, since, as discussed above, no records appear to exist for Aylesford,Saints Peter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aylesford&quot;/&gt; Based on the fact that the ''Hercules'' passenger list shows that Susanna and Thomas had 5 children as of March 1634/5, and assuming the first child was born 1 year after their marriage and assuming a 2-year gap between births, one derives an estimated marriage date of sometime in 1624-1627. Based on the possibility of miscarriages, still births, children who died young, and longer gaps between births, they could well have been married as early as, say, 1620. Based on the possibility of twins or shorter gaps between births, they could have been married as late as 1628. Anderson estimates that they were married &quot;by about 1624,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; although this suggests that 1624 was the later end of the possible range when, instead, it appears to be a reasonable midpoint. === Emigration to New England ===As discussed above under &quot;Origin,&quot; Susanna, her husband Thomas, and their five eldest children, Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan and Martha, emigrated to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', which departed Sandwich, England for New England in March 1634/5.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boys751&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Residency at Cambridge, Duxbury and Bridgewater ===As discussed in the profile for her husband, [[Hayward-270|Thomas Hayward]], Susanna and her family appear to have initially settled in Cambridge in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, moved to Duxbury in the Plymouth Colony by 1638, and finally moved to Bridgewater by 1658. === Children === Susanna and Thomas had the following children:# [[Hayward-130|Thomas]], b. in England perhaps about 1624,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; m. Sarah _______,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; d.s.p. before April17, 1699&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p293&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-172|John]], b. in England perhaps about 1626,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; m. by 1661 Sarah Mitchell.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; Commonly called John of the Plain to distinguish him from John Haward/Howard, the husband of his sister Martha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell177&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-1132|Elizabeth]], b. in England perhaps about 1628,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; m. October 20, 1645 John Ames,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; d.s.p. before May 28, 1705&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p293&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-352|Susanna]], b. in England perhaps about 1632,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; m. by 1654 John Richmond,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; d. before May 28, 1705 leaving issue&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p293&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-769|Martha]], b. in England perhaps about 1634, m. about 1653 John Haward/Howard in Duxbury, d. before September 1703 (see sources in Martha's profile)# [[Hayward-1091|Nathaniel]], b. perhaps about 1639&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; presumably in Duxbury,&lt;ref name=&quot;ParentsResidence&quot;/&gt; m. by 1664 Hannah Willis,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; d. after May 28, 1705&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-1119|Elisha]], born probably about 1642&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; presumably in Duxbury,&lt;ref name=&quot;ParentsResidence&quot;/&gt; never married,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; d. by September 22, 1710&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-174|Joseph]], b. perhaps about 1646&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; presumably in Duxbury,&lt;ref name=&quot;ParentsResidence&quot;/&gt; m. 1st by 1673 Alice Brett,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; m. 2d by 1682 Hannah Mitchell.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; Mitchell says there was an additional wife between AliceBrett and Hannah Mitchell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell177&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-170|Mary]], b. probably about 1648&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; presumably in Duxbury,&lt;ref name=&quot;ParentsResidence&quot;/&gt; m. about 1668 Edward Mitchell&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;The 1907 ''Dunham Genealogy'' states, without providing any source orexplanation, that Thomas Hayward also had a daughter named Mehitable,born about 1643, who married [[Dunham-170|Daniel Dunham]] in 1668.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunham300&quot;/&gt; No reliable evidence has been found for any such daughter, however, and Anderson doesn't even mention the theory. A 1954 article in TAG concluded that, contrary to the assertion in ''DunhamGenealogy'', Daniel Dunham's wife was named Hannah and that her maiden name was undetermined.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAG30p146&quot;/&gt; === Death ===Susanna's date and place of death are uncertain. No record that establishes her death has been found. Based on the fact that she was not mentioned in her husband's will which he made on June 29, 1678,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCW4p82&quot;/&gt; she presumably died before that date. Since she and her husband were residents of Bridgewater, she presumably died there. &lt;span class=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;PCW4p82&quot;&gt;Plymouth Colony Records, Wills, Vol. 4 1683-1686, Part 1, p 82.
