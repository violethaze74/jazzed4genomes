The Henry Rice who married Elizabeth Frost (who then went on to marry[[Whale-11|Philemon Whale II]]) has been thought to be brother or father of the immigrant [[Rice-52|Edmund Rice]] who settled in Sudbury, Massachusetts about 1638. &lt;ref&gt;''The American Genealogist,'' vol. 10, p134: QUOTE NEEDED&lt;/ref&gt;. == Biography ==. Henry Rice or Rys of Ratcliffe was born 1564 [others say 1588] in Wapping, Ratcliffe, East Mithfield, St. Katherine's Whitechapel, Middlesex [other say Suffolk], England. He married first 1605 [seems late given 1564 birth year; are we conflating two men here, one generation apart??] Elizabeth Frost... [is this right?]. In &quot;English Notes on Edmund Rice,&quot; Mary Lovering Holman&lt;ref&gt;''The American Genealogist,'' vol. 10, p133-137&lt;/ref&gt; had searched the church register from Stanstead, Suffolk, England with the following results:. One Henry Rice married Elizabeth Frost in November 1605.  Supposed children, recorded in this register include:. # Henry Ryce, son of Henry; buried September 1608. # Edward Ryce, baptized May 1608. # Henry Ryce, baptized Feb 1609/10;. # Elizabeth Ryce, baptized November 1612. # Mary Ryce, baptized Jun 1615. # Anne Ryce, baptized March 1617/8. One Henry Rice, the father?, was buried November 1621 in Stanstead.&lt;ref&gt;''The American Genealogist,'' vol. 10, p133-136&lt;/ref&gt; No will has been found. The Frosts were of Stanstead, but not the Rice name. == Research Notes ==:Henry Rice and his wife Elizabeth Frost '''were not''' the parents of the emigrant [[Rice-52|Edmund Rice]] of Sudbury, Massachusetts. Fromthe [http://edmund-rice.org/ancestors.htm  Edmund Rice (1638) Family Association]:. :Twice in the 20th century nationally recognized research genealogists have attempted to determine the parents and ancestors of Edmund Rice:# Mary Lovering Holman described the negative result of her search for records in the parishes near Stanstead and Sudbury, Suffolk County, England in &quot;English Notes on Edmund Rice … &quot;, ''The American Genealogist''', Volume 10 (1933/34), pp. 133 - 137. Mrs. Holman is consideredby many to be one of the best research genealogists in the 20th century.# In 1997, the Edmund Rice (1638) Association commissioned Dr. JoannaMartin, a nationally recognized research genealogist who lives in England only a few miles from Stanstead and Sudbury to search again for records of Edmund Rice's parents. Dr. Martin reported in 1999 that she found no record that identified Edmund's parents or ancestral line... :::From Mrs. Holman's paper we have an excellent record of one Henry Rice's marriage to Elizabeth Frost in November 1605 at Stanstead. Mrs. Holman also documents the baptism of Edmund's first child on 23 August 1619 at Stanstead. If this is the Henry Rice and Elizabeth Frost to which the LDS records refer, the LDS records must be erroneous... If Henry was the father of Edmund the immigrant, it would have been by an earlier wife. The Edmund Rice (1638) Association makes it very clear that no proof has been found of Edmund's parentage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edmund-rice.org/ancestors.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. == Sources ==. &lt;references /&gt;.
