James Keith (then 45), was initially opposed to Ephraim marrying his daughter: :[Mary Keith] was courted by Ephraim Howard, not much to the acceptance of the old minister. Notwithstanding his objection, they were secretly married, and were pursued by the irate father. Arriving too late to prevent their marriage, he returned, and, complying with the prevailing custom, preached the following Sabbath from Hosea 4:17- &quot;Ephraim is joined to idols let him alone.&quot; Time, however, softened his spirit, and the reconciliation which followed inclined him to preach from Jeremiah 31:20 - &quot;Is Ephraim my dear son? Is he a pleasant child? For since I spake against him I do earnestly remember him still.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Keith&quot;/&gt; Ephraim and Mary had the following children, all born in Bridgewater:# [[Howard-5037|Jane]], b.
