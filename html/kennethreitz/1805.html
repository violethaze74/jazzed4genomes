This is unlikely, since John Cutler did not die until 1685, and the marriage records for the Wetherbee/Moore marriage refers toWetherbee's wife as Lydia Moore, not Lydia Cutler. Additionally, she would have been 52 when her last child was born - not impossible, but unlikely. She  died 23 Nov 1723.

On 20 Jan 1668/9 John Maynard, husbandman, gave bond of 20 pounds forthe appearance of &quot;his daughter Lidiah&quot; to answer to a charge of fornication with Joseph Moore. On 26 Jan 1668/9, Joseph Moore confessed to fornication with Lydia Maynard and gave bond of 20 pounds for his appearance to answer the charge, with Jacob Moore (his brother) and Henry Rice as sureties. On 28 Jan 1668/9, Joseph Moore was summoned to answer for fornicationwith Lydia Maynard. Lydia married [[Moore-4393|Joseph Moore]] between 28 Jan 1668/9 (whenstill single, charged with fornication with each other, and she was no doubt pregnant) and 14 Apr 1669 when their son Benoni was born (Sudbury vital records); she is most definitely married by 5 Oct 1669 by which time the records refer to her as &quot;Lydia Maynard now Moore&quot;. She died 23 NOV 1717 Sudbury, Middlesex, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Sudbury Vital Records, Deaths, p 317&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 Oct 1669, petition by Elizabeth Moore, mother of Joseph, and Mary Maynard, mother of Lydia Maynard now Moore, seeking that the imposition of corporeal punishment for fornication on their children be relieved, and a fine imposed instead. The court minutes of the period are missing, so we do not know when the charge was first made, what exactlythe penalty was, or whether the petition of the mothers was respected. &lt;ref&gt;Neil D.

The Sudbury Vital Records gives both names on the same date, born June 1, 1644. In his will, John Maynard speaks of his daughter Lydia, wife of John Moore, and as there is no record of any other Lydia in his family, it seems probable that the daughter of his wife by her first husband,Thomas Axtell, is intended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; &gt;Axtell, Carson A.

His home lot was on the southwest of School and Division of the Meeting House Green. He was an old man when he died in 1645. His children were allborn in England, and all came to New England except his daughter Marywho married Mr. Rylie. His wife Joyce Baker was buried 24 May 1634 inSt. Peter's. William Frost was christened on 3 Aug 1589 in Stanstead, Suffolk, England. William married Abigail Bowser 29 Nov. 1610 at St. James in Stanstead. This is a 15th century flint pebble church with stone dressings. Thewest tower is earlier, with diagonal buttresses and a castellated parapet. : (So are we might be melding two William Frosts..because Stanstead is 200 kms from Nottingham where William’s second marriage supposedlytook place. Perhaps this is another William Frost?) William Frost married Joyse Barker at St. Mary's Church, England on 20 April 1612. The marriage was also recorded in the register of St. Nicholas Church, Nottingham.. They had at least five children including Elizabeth, our ancestor. Joyce Frost was buried 23 May 1634 (St. Peter's), Nottingham, Englandand on 23 Dec. 1634 William Frost married, at St. Peter's Church, thewidow Joane Lupton of Burton Joyce. They emigrated to Fairfield, New Haven Colony, now Connecticut. William was one of the early planners at Uncowa (Fairfield), beyond Connecticut William died in Fairfield in 1644/45. == Last Will &amp; Testament == The will of William Frost, drawn on 6 Jan. 1644/5 and proved that year at Fairfield, New Haven Colony, mentioned his &quot;eldest sonne Daniell Frost . . . , Rebecka and Sarah Frost [they were the testator's granddaughters, children of his son Daniel], . . . son Abraham . . . , my daughter Elizabeth and John Graye . . . , Luke Watson . . . , Susanna and Johana Watson, daughters to Elizabeth Graye, . . .

She married second, in Boston, Massachusetts, shortly after 6 July 1640, William Tilley, ten years her junior. She was a prominent midwife, ran afoul of the authorities and was jailed in 1648, resulting in a number of petitions for her support signedby dozens of Boston and Dorchester women. Her husband William Tilly hired Hugh Gullison [Gunnison?] to prosecute William Philips and his wife for slandering his wife. Around this time William and Alice left Boston for Cape Porpus, Maine. There is evidence that late in their lives (1665), Alice may have left William for lack of support.  William petitioned the court who ordered that they return to living together as man and wife and that he support her. Punishment for not doing so would be 40 pounds for him and imprisonment for her. She was alive as late as 27 March 1668. == Sources == &lt;references /&gt; &lt;!-- Please edit, add, or delete anything in this text, including this note. Be bold and experiment!

An April 1714 Middlesex Co probate [citation?] gave the illusion of such a child, but subsequent research revealed this 1714 probate action was for son EDWARD. Somehow this probate involved the estateof the old man Edmund Rice Senior because essentially every one one his offspring had a descendant represented in that probate (see the Ward ca1857 Rice book, the very same book that created the false illusionof a son Edmund). The Edmund Rice (1638) Association estimates that after 13 or 14 generations, descendants of Edmund Rice may be in the many hundreds of thousands to millions. == Sources == &lt;references /&gt; See also: (remove those that are already referenced in footnotes) * Attached Documents.* [http://www.gulbangi.com/genrpts/desctwheeler.pdf  Descendants of Thomas Wheeler (9422)] * ''History of the Town of Marborough,'' Pages 240-247 * ''The American Genealogist,'' 65 (1990): page #s? * Research of [[Adamson-409|J.
