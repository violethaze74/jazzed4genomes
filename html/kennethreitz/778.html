Fromthe [http://edmund-rice.org/ancestors.htm  Edmund Rice (1638) Family Association]: :Twice in the 20th century nationally recognized research genealogists have attempted to determine the parents and ancestors of Edmund Rice:# Mary Lovering Holman described the negative result of her search for records in the parishes near Stanstead and Sudbury, Suffolk County, England in &quot;English Notes on Edmund Rice … &quot;, ''The American Genealogist''', Volume 10 (1933/34), pp. 133 - 137. Mrs. Holman is consideredby many to be one of the best research genealogists in the 20th century.# In 1997, the Edmund Rice (1638) Association commissioned Dr. JoannaMartin, a nationally recognized research genealogist who lives in England only a few miles from Stanstead and Sudbury to search again for records of Edmund Rice's parents. Dr. Martin reported in 1999 that she found no record that identified Edmund's parents or ancestral line... :::From Mrs. Holman's paper we have an excellent record of one Henry Rice's marriage to Elizabeth Frost in November 1605 at Stanstead. Mrs. Holman also documents the baptism of Edmund's first child on 23 August 1619 at Stanstead. If this is the Henry Rice and Elizabeth Frost to which the LDS records refer, the LDS records must be erroneous... If Henry was the father of Edmund the immigrant, it would have been by an earlier wife.
