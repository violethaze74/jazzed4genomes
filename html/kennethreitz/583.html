The first settler who &quot;penetrated the wilds of Blockley&quot;. was William Warner, of Blockley, England.

Warner built his house on what afterwards was Forty-fifth. and Westminster Avenue. He named his plantation. &quot;Blockley&quot; after his home in England. He landed at Upland,. now Chester. His title was confirmed by William Penn. John Warner, a brother of William, soon followed. him, coming over with Penn, and settled nearby. Both. were members of the first Pennsylvania Legislature. The name of Duckett, Warner, Kite and others, all. early members of the Schuylkill Friends' Meeting, appear. on the records at the Friends' Meeting House, Fifteenth. and Race Streets, Philadelphia.
