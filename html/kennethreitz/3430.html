The first settler who &quot;penetrated the wilds of Blockley&quot; was William Warner, of Blockley, England. He was a resident as early as 1677, having arrived before the great influx of either Welsh or English colonists. William Warner built his house on what afterwards was Forty-fifth and Westminster Avenue. He named his plantation &quot;Blockley&quot; after his home in England. He landed at Upland, now Chester. His title was confirmed by William Penn. John Warner, a brother of William, soon followed him, coming over with Penn, and settled nearby. Both were members of the first Pennsylvania Legislature. The name of Duckett, Warner, Kite and others, all early members of the Schuylkill Friends' Meeting, appear on the records at the Friends' Meeting House, Fifteenth and Race Streets, Philadelphia. Mary Warner, daughter of William Warner, married Thomas W'ynn, grandson of Dr. Thomas Wynne. &lt;ref&gt;Develin, Mrs. Dora Harvey.

After coming to America and associating with members of the Society of Friends, most of their children married into that sect, although there is no evidence that Wil- liam and Anne ever belonged to any of their meetings. Anne (Dyde) \Varner survived her husband. By his will he divided his lands between his sons, John and Isaac, and his deceased daughter's husband, James Kite and his children. His son, William, was provided for by other means. To his son, Robert, in England, he gave his estate at Draycott, \Vor- cestershire, England. His estate “Blockley” went to his widow and son, Isaac.
