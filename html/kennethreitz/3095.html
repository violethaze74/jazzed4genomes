John of St. David's the father of the four Myricks who came to New England, however, no proof is given and he admits that: &quot;This is pure assumption, as no record of John's children has as yet been found... this writer bequeaths this, with many other unsolved riddles, to the successor whom he hopes and believes will some time revise, correct, and enlarge the present work&quot;.(&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) Tradition states that James and his younger brother John (b.c.1614) came from St. David's, Pembrokeshire and that they arrived in America in 1636 on the &quot;James&quot; but, they are not listed on the shipping lists and no authority is given for this statement. James and John were early inhabitants of Charlestown, MA where John was granted a house lot in 1644. The grant to James has not been found but, he owned land there before 1649 since it is mentioned as a bound in that year. In 1655/6 the bounds of his and John's lands were finally settled. James was a cooper and fish-monger owning a wharf in Charlestown. John was also a cooper and he attached the wharf of Henry Kemble because Henry had taken a son of his and withheld a writing (John had apprenticed his son to Henry). James testified about 1653, aged forty years, that John Smith took mackerel at the house of Edward Johnson and on 22 May 1653 he again testified in court aged 40 years. Before 1657 James moved to Newbury where he remained for some years and where most of his children were born. On 13 May 1657 John Andrews of Charlestown purchased land there from &quot;James Mirack, Cooper and Margerite his wife.&quot; After the birth of his last child in 1670 James moved to Boston but, returned to Newbury before 1681. Later his son James Jr. went to Boston to live. On 25 Oct. 1676 James Sr. of Boston sold to James Jr. his house lot in Newbury with all of the household goods for £40. James Jr. was also to receive from his brother the last year's rent of 40/. James Jr. of Newbury then sold the house to William Ellsby of Newbury for £40 15 June 1679. I James Myrick senior of Boston… doe resigne over all my right… that I have in a houselott… in Newbury… with all the household stuff therein… my said sonne James Myrick shall… have… the premises above mentioned…. James Myrick is to pay unto his said ffather JamesMyrick the full Sum of forty pounds… within two years… and to Demand of his Brother the last yeares rent, the sum of forty shillings”  The deed is dated 25 Oct. 1676 and was witnessed by Josiah Cobham and John Fernside.(&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) I James Mirick Junr of Newbury… for Forty Pounds… do… sell… unto William Ellsly of Newbury… that house &amp; land wc I… bought of my ffather Mirick”.  The deed is dated 15 June 1679.(&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) In 1681 John Atkinson (daughter Sarah's husband) sued Sarah Stickney for slander in the Essex County Court. The testimonies in this case prove that Sarah was the daughter of James and not his sister as stated by some. James Meyrick / Mirick / Myrick / Merrick born in 1612 in St. Davids, Pembrokeshire, Wales to John &quot;Sion&quot;Merrick and Dorothy (Unknown) Merrick.  He died on April 2, 1708 in  Newbury, Essex County, Massachusetts, USA.  AKA:  &quot;Mirick&quot;, &quot;Merrick&quot;. (I suspect the James who died in 1708 is a different person.  James the immigrant drops out of the records after 1681.)
