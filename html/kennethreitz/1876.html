Thomas Marshfield was on board and migrated on this ship.&lt;ref name=GM /&gt;  John Winthrop wrote the following about him:   &quot;One thing I think fit to observe, as a witness of God's providence for this plantation. There came in this ship one Marisfeild, a poor godly man of Exeter, being very desirous to come to us, but not able to transport his family. There was in the city a rich merchant, one Marshall, who being troubled in his dreams about the said poor man, couldnot be quiet till he had sent for him and given him £50, and lent him £100, willing him withal, that, if he wanted, he should send to himfor more.

More people are credited with being on the Mary and John than the ship could possibly hold. Given that their daughter Sarah was born in England in 1633 and the first record of the family in New England isn't until 1635, the Mary and John supposition as the immigrant ship is clearly an old error.&quot; - Joe Cochoit == Sources == &lt;references /&gt; ===Acknowledgements===* WikiTree profile Marshfield-21 created through the import of JOSEPH~1.GED on Jul 14, 2012 by [[Stalnaker-102 | Joseph Stalnaker]].<br/><span id='n3'>3.</span> {{Puritan Great Migration}} [[Category:Accused Witches of New England]] == Biography ==Mercy (Unknown) Marshfield&lt;ref name=TAG67&gt;The American Genealogist.

Married to Thomas Miller at Springfield on October 12, 1649 - he was killed by the Indians at the burning of Springfield on October 5, 1675.

He died February 22, 1719/20.  Edward's 1st wife was Hester Bliss who was born about 1640 and died at Springfield on June 12, 1683; daughter of Thomas and Margaret (Hullings) Bliss. Edward Foster testified that he came from &quot;Barnett&quot; in England on September 9, 1650. #Priscilla died at Windsor, Connecticut on October 20, 1639. By May 15, 1637 the family was living at Windsor, Connecticut where he had a land grant but sold part of it in 1642 to Thomas Newell probably because of serious financial problems.  On October 14, 1642 the court &quot;took into custody all of Thomas Marshfield's estate, goods and chattels to pay his debts,&quot; afterwhich he may have returned to England but it is far likely that he died for his wife was herafter known as &quot;Widow Marshfield&quot; when by 1649 she had moved to Springfield, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=TAG67 /&gt;Her husband had probably died shortly after his last appearance in the records of  Windsor in 1642.&lt;ref name=TAG63 /&gt;  A grant for a homelot in Springfield has not been found, indicating she may have moved to Springfield to join her married daugher whose husband had received a homelot grant.&lt;ref name=TAG67 /&gt; At court in Springfield in 1649 she, Widow Marshfield, was accused ofwitchcraft by Goodwife Parsons wife of Hugh Parsons.  The accusation was that that Widow Marshfield had caused one of the Parson's childrenand one cow to die.  It came out in testimony that this Widow Maarshfield was the same as wife of Thomas Marshfield who had previously lived in Widsor, Connecticut.  At the time of these court proceedings, Widow Marshfield had three children, one of which was married and had a child. &lt;ref name=TAG63 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TAG67 /&gt; Widow Marshfield brought the accusation to court to protect her good name and on May 30, 1649 the court ruled in her favor.  Goodwife Parsons was order to pay L3 to the widow Marshfield or else be whipped twenty lashes.  She payed the fine rather than the whipping.&lt;ref name=TAG67 /&gt; In a search for the name of widow Marshfield's son-in-law, the only man who seems likely to be him is  John Dumbleton, whose wife Mercy hadnot previously been identified.  Richardson in ''&quot;Thomas Marshfield'sWife Mercy; Did Their Daughter Mercy Marry John Dumbleton?&quot;'' found there were no other candidates except him who lived in the small town of Springfield and fit the profile he was looking for;  all other men of that age were already accounted for.  Since the Springfield vital records show no record of the daughter's marriage nor the birth of theirchild, the timeline for the events seem to be:#The eldest daughter, named Mercy, married her husband while still inWindsor.#The couple had their first born child in Springfield before the moveto Windsor.#They had their 2nd child named John, born at Springfield on January 2, 1650/1.&lt;ref name=TAG67 /&gt; Naming of the additional children of John and Mercy (Marshfield) Dumbleton is significant.  There was a 2nd daughter by the name of Mercy; two sons named Samuel after Mercy Dumbleton's brother; a third daughter named Sarah (for Mercy Dumbleton's only sister Sarah (Marshfield).  Sarah, Thomas and Mercy Marshfield's other daughter, as well as Samueltheir son, used similar naming patterns.&lt;ref name=TAG67 /&gt; The widow of Thomas Marshfield, Mercy Marshfield, died and was buriedat Springfield on September 30, 1654.&lt;ref name=TAG67 /&gt;Her given nameappears in her death record according to the research of Douglas RICHARDSON in his article at The American Genealogist.&lt;ref name=TAG67 /&gt; == Sources == &lt;references /&gt; *The American Genealogist.
