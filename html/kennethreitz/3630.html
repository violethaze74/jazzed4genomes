He was the son of Johann Casper and Susannah Schneible of Northampton County Pennsylvania. He immigrated in 1748 with his parents on the ship &quot;Patience&quot; which set harbor in Philadelphia. His father was the seventeenth person to sign the usual forms atPhiladelphia Court House on September 16 1748. He married Elisabethe and was the father of Jacob Hepler and grandfather of William Hepler .George Jacob Hepler signed Oath of Allegiance in Northampton County Pennsylvania on January 23rd 1778. He signed his name as Jacob. : He fought in the Revolution along with his brothers.: Jacob at once joined the regiment under Colonel Seigfried at Bethlehem, Pa. This outfit was part of General Israel Putman's Brigade, the man who made famous the saying &quot;Don't shoot till you see the whites oftheir eyes.&quot; Casper joined Colonel Kooken's Company, Second Battalion, Northampton County, Pa. and George Hepler in the Sixth Battalion, under Captain Jacob Peterman.: Again in the Militia Rolls of 1785 appear the names of Casper Hepler, Jacob Hepler and Stoffel Hepler.: Jacob Hepler with his large family and many of his neighbors left Northampton Co. in 1785. They settled for a short time in Luzerne Co, Nescopeck Twp. Among taxables in 1790 were names like Henry, Casper, John and Adam, familar names in Western Pennsylvania, also Jacob,&amp; HenryHepler, a little later Henry &amp; George Daubenspeck. This confirms the tradition of descendants of Christian Hepler that the Hepler's came toLuzerne Co. A part of Jacob Hepler's large family was recorded in this county in the 1790 census. There were two boys over 16 years old, Christian age 20 &amp; Daniel age 18 years, five under 16 and one girl. :: Jacob had evidently traveled ahead to Allegheny Co., bringing with him 2 boys under 16 and 4 girls, making a family of 7 boys and 5 girls. In 1792 Jacob helped in the defense of the frontier against the Indians. In 1796,he began improvement on his tract of land in Buffalo Twp., northeast of the Allegheny river, on April 7, 1797 He began his improvement in July of 1796. He had the land surveyed in 1802, found that James McCoy had a warrent for the same land dated February 23 1794. Donot know how the affair was settled, but Jacob was living on this tract or part of it at the time of his death.: Jacob Hepler lived on this land in Armstrong Co. He perhaps was permitted to keep the part he had improved by 1802. In 1807 Frederick Shoop had 416 acres of James McCoy's land surveyed and encountered the same opposition as Jacob Hepler, but through some arrangement Frederick Shoop sold this land to the Harmons, Lunberrys and Blains Inc., including a portion of land occupied by Jacob Hepler. Buffalo Township became a part of Sugar Creek Township later. Jacob &amp; Elizabeth are buried in the Wilson cemetery below White Oak Cemetery in now Butler County. Anew tombstone was erected in 1941. A new Government tombstone thatwasalso erected at that time, states that Jacob was a pvt. in the 4th PaBN PA MIL REV WAR&lt;ref&gt;[http://trees.ancestry.com/tree/3770732/person/-1683298865/story/31d1e755-2edf-45e5-bd68-c243204649b3?src=search&amp;ftm=1 Source Link]&lt;/ref&gt; : Note: [[#N33]] === Marriage === : Husband:  [[Hepler-163|Georg Jacob Hepler]] : Wife:  [[Yockey-74|Elisabethe Yockey]] : Child:  [[Hepler-154|David Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-147|Christopher Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-140|Casper Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-194|Peter Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-131|Adam U Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-144|Christian Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-135|Anna Margaretha Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-150|Daniel Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-164|Georg Jacob Jr. Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-181|John B.
