Great Migration|GM2|VI, R-S|497}} ==Disputed Origins==According to Robert Charles Anderson's &quot;The Great Migration Directory&quot;, 2015, page 226, Thomas Merrick's origins are unknown. Anderson indicates that he immigrated in 1637, and there are records for him in Hartford and Springfield. Based on Anderson's information and WikiTree policy, Thomas Merrick's relationship to his parents [[Meyrick-4|John Meyrick]] and [[Bishop-985|Dorothy Bishop]], has been changed to 'Uncertain'. == Biography == Thomas Merrick, the immigrant ancestor of the Merrick family in America, was born about 1620, probably at Pembroke in Wales. He came to America on the James in 1636 with his three brothers and probably one sister.&lt;ref&gt;Genealogy of the Merrick-Mirick-Meyrick Family of Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt;  According to one family story, the brothers separated, one going to Eastham, one to Newbury and one remained in Charlestown.  His putative sister, Sarah Mirick, married John Atkinson at Newbury in 1646. Thomas first settled in Roxbury, then moved to Hartford, then up the Connecticut River to Agawam by 1638;&lt;ref&gt;Genealogy of the Merrick-Mirick-Meyrick Family of Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; Agawam soon became known as Springfield, Massachusetts.

His birthplace has been given as St. David's in Pembrokeshire. His birth year unclear - some sources say 1608 and others say 1620. 1620 is unlikely, because men had to be at least 21 to gain status as freemen, and most attained that status between about 25 and 30. Thomas could not have received land until he was a freeman. Since Thomas had married and received land by 1639, he had to have been born by 1618. He was also one of six men ordered toparticipate in a diplomatic mission to the Warranocke Indians &quot;to know the reasons why they said they are afraid of us&quot; in April 1638.&lt;ref&gt;Great Migration: Immigrants to New England, 1634-1635, Volume VI, R-S,p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt;It is highly unlikely that this delicate of a task wouldhave been entrusted to a teenager. From the ''Genealogy of the Merrick Family of Massachusetts'':: &quot;Thomas Merrick... came to America in the year 1636 with three brothers and probably one sister, Sarah Mirick, who married John Atkinson,at Newbury, 1646. The brothers separated, one going to Plymouth, later to Eastham, one to Newbury, and one remaining in Charlestown. ThomasMerrick is noted as having been in Roxbury in 1636... He was in Agawam [Springfield] on the 3rd day of January, 1638, according to the records of that plantation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; ''Merrick genealogy'', p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; : &quot;According to the records he was married to his first wife, Sarah, daughter of Rowland and Sarah Stebbins, July 14, 1639. She died after having borne him five children, and he married, 2d, Elizabeth Tilley, Aug. 21, 1653... By his second wife Thomas Merrick had eight children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Merrick genealogy,'' p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth died on August 21, 1684 and Thomas died twenty years later on September 7, 1704.

They had no children. When Mathew passed away in 1718 he left a will dated Jul 16, 1718 in which Hannah is named his executor.  Mathew instructed that Hannah receive his house and land to use for her natural life after which it wasto go to Mathew Crowfoot the son of James Crowfoot of Danbury, Connecticut. It is not known when Hannah passed away but it is obviously after July 16, 1718 in Springfield.
