Dr. Martin reported in 1999 that she found no record that identified Edmund's parents or ancestral line... :::From Mrs. Holman's paper we have an excellent record of one Henry Rice's marriage to Elizabeth Frost in November 1605 at Stanstead. Mrs. Holman also documents the baptism of Edmund's first child on 23 August 1619 at Stanstead. If this is the Henry Rice and Elizabeth Frost to which the LDS records refer, the LDS records must be erroneous... If Henry was the father of Edmund the immigrant, it would have been by an earlier wife.
