With a corrected reading of Winthrop's Journal , Thomas is identified as arriving from Barnstable, Devonshire aboard the ''Regard'' in 1634. The revised entry for Nov. 13, 1634 is:. &quot;The ''Regard'', a ship of Barnstable, of about two hundred tons, arrived in 1634 with twenty passengers and about fifty cattle. Thomas Marshfield was on board and migrated on this ship.&lt;ref name=GM /&gt;  John Winthrop wrote the following about him:   &quot;One thing I think fit to observe, as a witness of God's providence for this plantation. There came in this ship one Marisfeild, a poor godly man of Exeter, being very desirous to come to us, but not able to transport his family. There was in the city a rich merchant, one Marshall, who being troubled in his dreams about the said poor man, couldnot be quiet till he had sent for him and given him £50, and lent him £100, willing him withal, that, if he wanted, he should send to himfor more.

More people are credited with being on the Mary and John than the ship could possibly hold. Given that their daughter Sarah was born in England in 1633 and the first record of the family in New England isn't until 1635, the Mary and John supposition as the immigrant ship is clearly an old error.&quot; - Joe Cochoit. == Sources ==. &lt;references /&gt;. ===Acknowledgements===* WikiTree profile Marshfield-21 created through the import of JOSEPH~1.GED on Jul 14, 2012 by [[Stalnaker-102 | Joseph Stalnaker]].</p> <p style='margin-top: 0.1em; margin-bottom: 0.2em;'>One son and 3 daughters listed.</p> </td> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td>(unknown image type)</td> </tr> </table> <h3 style='clear: both; margin-bottom: 0.5em; padding-top: 0.5em;'>Children</h3> <table><tr><td style='text-align: right; width: 4em;'>i</td> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td><p style='margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.2em;'><span class='c-nar-indi'><a href='287.html'>Samuel MARSHFIELD</a></span><sup><span class='c-fj-n'><a href='289.html#n1'>1</a></span></sup> was born about 1626 in Exeter, Devonshire, England.
