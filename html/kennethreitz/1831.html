His home lot was on the southwest of School and Division of the Meeting House Green. He was an old man when he died in 1645. His children were allborn in England, and all came to New England except his daughter Marywho married Mr. Rylie. His wife Joyce Baker was buried 24 May 1634 inSt. Peter's. William Frost was christened on 3 Aug 1589 in Stanstead, Suffolk, England. William married Abigail Bowser 29 Nov. 1610 at St. James in Stanstead. This is a 15th century flint pebble church with stone dressings. Thewest tower is earlier, with diagonal buttresses and a castellated parapet. : (So are we might be melding two William Frosts..because Stanstead is 200 kms from Nottingham where William’s second marriage supposedlytook place. Perhaps this is another William Frost?) William Frost married Joyse Barker at St. Mary's Church, England on 20 April 1612. The marriage was also recorded in the register of St. Nicholas Church, Nottingham.. They had at least five children including Elizabeth, our ancestor. Joyce Frost was buried 23 May 1634 (St. Peter's), Nottingham, Englandand on 23 Dec. 1634 William Frost married, at St. Peter's Church, thewidow Joane Lupton of Burton Joyce. They emigrated to Fairfield, New Haven Colony, now Connecticut. William was one of the early planners at Uncowa (Fairfield), beyond Connecticut William died in Fairfield in 1644/45. == Last Will &amp; Testament == The will of William Frost, drawn on 6 Jan. 1644/5 and proved that year at Fairfield, New Haven Colony, mentioned his &quot;eldest sonne Daniell Frost . . . , Rebecka and Sarah Frost [they were the testator's granddaughters, children of his son Daniel], . . . son Abraham . . . , my daughter Elizabeth and John Graye . . . , Luke Watson . . . , Susanna and Johana Watson, daughters to Elizabeth Graye, . . .

Anderson discusses the discrepancy between ages given by Alice at various depositions (calculating back to a 1602/3 birth) and her 1594 baptism, and concludes that &quot;in her eighth decade Alice chose to present herself as a younger woman, given that she was more than a decade older than William Tilley.&quot; She married first 19 Nov 1612 in Stanstead, Suffolk, Thomas Blower, by whom she had at least one son, John, baptized in Sudbury, Suffolk Feb 1627/8.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Charles Anderson, &quot;Alice (Frost) (Blower) Tilley,&quot; in ''The American Genealogist,'' vol 71 (1996), [https://www.americanancestors.org/databases/american-genealogist-the/image?volumeId=13131&amp;pageName=113&amp;rId=234373432 p 113] (membership required)&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson and others make the case that she was also mother (by Blower) of Sarah who years later called [William] Tilley father, Tilley being too young to be Sarah's father, she must have been his step daughter. She married second, in Boston, Massachusetts, shortly after 6 July 1640, William Tilley, ten years her junior. She was a prominent midwife, ran afoul of the authorities and was jailed in 1648, resulting in a number of petitions for her support signedby dozens of Boston and Dorchester women. Her husband William Tilly hired Hugh Gullison [Gunnison?] to prosecute William Philips and his wife for slandering his wife. Around this time William and Alice left Boston for Cape Porpus, Maine. There is evidence that late in their lives (1665), Alice may have left William for lack of support.  William petitioned the court who ordered that they return to living together as man and wife and that he support her. Punishment for not doing so would be 40 pounds for him and imprisonment for her. She was alive as late as 27 March 1668. == Sources == &lt;references /&gt; &lt;!-- Please edit, add, or delete anything in this text, including this note. Be bold and experiment!

An April 1714 Middlesex Co probate [citation?] gave the illusion of such a child, but subsequent research revealed this 1714 probate action was for son EDWARD. Somehow this probate involved the estateof the old man Edmund Rice Senior because essentially every one one his offspring had a descendant represented in that probate (see the Ward ca1857 Rice book, the very same book that created the false illusionof a son Edmund). The Edmund Rice (1638) Association estimates that after 13 or 14 generations, descendants of Edmund Rice may be in the many hundreds of thousands to millions. == Sources == &lt;references /&gt; See also: (remove those that are already referenced in footnotes) * Attached Documents.* [http://www.gulbangi.com/genrpts/desctwheeler.pdf  Descendants of Thomas Wheeler (9422)] * ''History of the Town of Marborough,'' Pages 240-247 * ''The American Genealogist,'' 65 (1990): page #s? * Research of [[Adamson-409|J.
