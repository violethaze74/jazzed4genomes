Anderson discusses the discrepancy between ages given by Alice at various depositions (calculating back to a 1602/3 birth) and her 1594 baptism, and concludes that &quot;in her eighth decade Alice chose to present herself as a younger woman, given that she was more than a decade older than William Tilley.&quot; She married first 19 Nov 1612 in Stanstead, Suffolk, Thomas Blower, by whom she had at least one son, John, baptized in Sudbury, Suffolk Feb 1627/8.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Charles Anderson, &quot;Alice (Frost) (Blower) Tilley,&quot; in ''The American Genealogist,'' vol 71 (1996), [https://www.americanancestors.org/databases/american-genealogist-the/image?volumeId=13131&amp;pageName=113&amp;rId=234373432 p 113] (membership required)&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson and others make the case that she was also mother (by Blower) of Sarah who years later called [William] Tilley father, Tilley being too young to be Sarah's father, she must have been his step daughter. She married second, in Boston, Massachusetts, shortly after 6 July 1640, William Tilley, ten years her junior. She was a prominent midwife, ran afoul of the authorities and was jailed in 1648, resulting in a number of petitions for her support signedby dozens of Boston and Dorchester women. Her husband William Tilly hired Hugh Gullison [Gunnison?] to prosecute William Philips and his wife for slandering his wife. Around this time William and Alice left Boston for Cape Porpus, Maine. There is evidence that late in their lives (1665), Alice may have left William for lack of support.  William petitioned the court who ordered that they return to living together as man and wife and that he support her. Punishment for not doing so would be 40 pounds for him and imprisonment for her. She was alive as late as 27 March 1668. == Sources == &lt;references /&gt; &lt;!-- Please edit, add, or delete anything in this text, including this note. Be bold and experiment!
