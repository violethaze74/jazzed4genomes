Many genealogical studies of John(1) Moore and his family claim that his last wife was Elizabeth, daughter of Philemon1 Whale of Sudbury, who calls her his daughter in his will. Many have taken this to mean that she was Elizabeth, bapt 31 Jan 1593 to Philemon Whale in Checkney, Essex England.&lt;ref&gt;IGI Batch #F506660, sheet 047, call #1553362, citing Film 455484, Parish Registers of Chickney, Essex; baptisms&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Charles Anderson&lt;ref&gt;Robert Charles Anderson, &quot;The English Origins of Philemon Whale of Sudbury, Massachusetts,'' in ''The Genealogist,'' 6 (1985):131-41&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that she was actually a daughter of Henry and Elizabeth (Frost) Rice of Stanstead, co. Suffolk, England, and a ''stepdaughter'' of Philemon Whale, who married Henry Rice'swidow. Philemon Whale did not marry Elizabeth Frost (widow of Henry Rice) until 1621, had their first child (dau Sarah) in 1622; a subsequent birth of Elizabeth would too late to parent the Elizabeth who marries in 1639. Then to really confirm this, &quot;...a microfilm of a transcript of the Bishop's Transcripts for Little Gaddesden was checked (FHL #1040857, item 3)... under the date of 27 Nov 1633, we find the marriage of 'Johannes More &amp; Elizabetha Rice.&quot; ... There can be no doubt that this is the marriage of the immigrants to Sudbury, Mass.&lt;ref&gt;John Plummer, &quot;The English Origin of John1 Moore of Sudbury, Massachusetts,&quot; in ''The American Genealogist,'' 66(1991):75-77&lt;/ref&gt; == Biography == She was baptized 18 Nov 1612 in Stanstead, Suffolk, England, daughterof Henry Rice (d. 1620) and Elizabeth Frost. She married John Moore 27 Nov 1633 in Little Gaddesden, England. She died 14 Dec 1690 in Sudbury, Middlesex, Massachusetts. == Sources == &lt;references /&gt; &lt;!-- Please edit, add, or delete anything in this text, including this note. Be bold and experiment!
