===Martha Hayward was the daughter of  [[Hayward-270|Thomas Hayward, Sr.]] and his wife [[Towne-491|Susanna (Unknown) Hayward]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; Based on the fact that Martha's name was included among Thomas's family members enrolled for passage to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', under a minister's certification dated March 14, 1634/5, &lt;refname=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; she was born sometime before that date. Anderson estimates that she was born &quot;say 1635,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; apparently based on the date he estimated for her parents' marriage and for her siblings' dates of birth. However, since all those dates seem to be rough estimates and the window for her birth in 1635 is very small, it is very possible (if not likely) that Martha wasborn somewhat earlier.  Since the ''Hercules'' passenger lists statesthat Thomas and his family were from Aylesford, England, Martha was very probably born there.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Emigration to New England ===Martha and her family sailed from Sandwich, England to New England in1635 aboard the ship ''Hercules'', John Witherley, master.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hotten&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; They settled first at Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Removal to Duxbury ===Martha's family moved from Cambridge to Duxbury by 1638.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p289&quot;/&gt; === &quot;Vain, Light and Lascivious Carriage&quot; ===At a Grand Inquest on June 8, 1651, Martha Haward of Duxbury, along with John Shaw, James Shaw, Samuel Cutbert and Benjamin Eaton of Plymouth and Goodwife Gannett and William Snow of Duxbury, were presented for &quot;vaine, light and lacivius carriage at an unseasonable time of night.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR2p170&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; At the General Court at New Plymouth on October 7, 1651, the Court, &quot;not finding them alike faulty, have fined James Shaw and Goodwife Ganett thirty shillings apeace . . . and Samuell Cutbert, William Snow, Benjamine Eaton and Martha Haward are released, with admonishion to take heed of such evell carriages for the future. And as for John Shaw, he is lyable to punishment when oppertunitie serveth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR2p172&quot;/&gt; === Marriage ===Martha married John Haward/Howard.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; The first name of John Haward/Howard's wife is confirmed by records of the division of his estate, which refer to his widow Martha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard3-4&quot;/&gt; The identity of John Haward/Howard's wife as a daughter of ThomasHayward is confirmed by a quitclaim by John's children of rights to property bequeathed by Peter Town to Thomas Hayward's children.&lt;ref name=&quot;MiddlesexDeeds23p398&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p293&quot;/&gt; Some family trees state that Martha and John were married on April 6,1657 in Dennis, Barnstable County. However, both the date and location seem very improbable, and no reliable sources supporting either thatdate or location have been found. Based on the estimated dates of birth of their children, Martha and John were probably married sometime in 1652-1655.

John Hayward of Bridgewater]], who was the brother-in-law of this profile's Lt. JohnHaward of Bridgewater.''' == Biography == === Name ===Original records for this profile's John Howard of Bridgewater consistently spell his name as &quot;Haward,&quot; with a few exceptions that spell his name &quot;Heyward,&quot; &quot;Hayward&quot; or &quot;Heward.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; No original record has been found that spells his name &quot;Howard&quot; during his lifetime, although Mitchell assures us that that is how his name was pronounced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; He was often referred to in the original records by his military title of &quot;Ensign&quot; subsequent to his appointment to that position in 1664 and as &quot;Lieutenant&quot; subsequent to his promotion to that position in 1689.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; He was also sometimes referred to in the original records as John Haward Senior in order to distinguish him from hisyounger brother-in-law, John Hayward/Haward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; (&quot;Senior&quot; was not needed to distinguish him from his son John at the timeSenior was used in the records, as his son was still quite young at the time of those records.) === Earliest Plymouth Records === The earliest Plymouth Colony records of a John Haward/Heyward are:* A June 7, 1637 list of names of soldiers willing to to assist the colonies of Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut in their wars against thePequin Indians, which includes the name &quot;John Heyward.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR1p61&quot;/&gt;* A record of a grant at a Plymouth town meeting on October 17, 1642 to &quot;John Heyward&quot; of a garden place next Andrew Ringe and 10 acres of upland at Fresh Lake by the fishing point.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR2p48&quot;/&gt;Curiously, none of the secondary sources for this profile's John Haward/Heyward mention those records. The first record of this profile's John Haward/Heyward mentioned in secondary sources is a 1643 list of names of males in Duxbury aged 16-60 able to bear arms, which includes the name &quot;John Heyward.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p190&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; There is some evidence that there might have been two John Heywards in the Plymouth Colony. The same 1643 list of names of males aged 16-60able to bear arms includes two John Heywards: one in Plymouth&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p188&quot;/&gt; and one in Duxbury. In addition, the 1657 record of mentaking the oath of fidelity in the Plymouth Colony includes two John Hawards: one in Plymouth&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p181&quot;/&gt; and one in Bridgewater.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p185&quot;/&gt; Assuming that the same person was not listed intwo towns, it thus seems likely that there was a John Heyward/Haward of Plymouth and a John Heyward/Haward of Duxbury/Bridgewater and that the 1637 and 1642 Plymouth Colony records for John Heyward relate to the former. === Parentage; Date and Place of Birth ===John's parentage is unknown, except perhaps for the first name of hismother. The &quot;Howard Genealogy&quot; contains a copy of a letter dated August 16, 1652 by a Mary Hayward in London to her son John Hayward in NewEngland that was in the possession of a member of the Howard family and was supposedly written to this profile's John Haward/Hayward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howardxvi&quot;/&gt; (An image purportedly of the original letter is attached to this profile.) Assuming that letter is authentic and relates to this profile's John Haward/Hayward, his mother's name was Mary and she was living in London in 1652. Some family trees say that John was the son of a James Howard/Haward and a Mary Cooper, but no reliable evidence for that parentage has been found. John's date of birth is uncertain. Assuming that the secondary sources are correct and that the first record of this profile's John Haward/Heyward is the 1643 list of males of Duxborrow 16-60 years old able tobear arms (and not the earlier Plymouth records for a &quot;John Heyward&quot;), John was probably born sometime in 1623-1627 based on (i) the fact that his inclusion in the 1643 list means that he was at least 16 in 1643 and thus born no later than 1627 and (ii) the fact that the earliest estimated date of birth of one of his children (1653) suggests that he was probably not older than 30 years old at that date and thus was probably born no earlier than 1623. If, on the other hand, the 1637 record for &quot;John Heyward&quot; relates to this profiles John Haward/Heyward, he was probably born no later than 1621 (since, to volunteer for military service, he probably needed to be at least 16 years old). John's place of birth is also uncertain. It is very likely that he was born in England.  Some family trees say that John was born in Sandwich, Kent, but no reliable evidence supporting that proposition has been found. Assuming the letter referred to above is authentic and relates to this profile's John Howard, it is quite possible that he was bornin London, since his mother was living there in 1652. === Immigration to New England ===John Haward's date of immigration is uncertain and his means of immigration are unknown. Based on the assumption that John was the &quot;John Heyward&quot; included in a 1643 list of men of Duxbury, Plymouth Colony 16-60 years old able to bear arms,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p190&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; he immigrated sometime before that date. === Age at Immigration; Brought up by Miles Standish? ===Based on John's estimated date of birth (1623-1627), John was still aminor when he immigrated. This is consistent with &quot;History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater,&quot; which states that John &quot;was young when he came over,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; and with  the &quot;Howard Genealogy&quot;, which states (without support) that John was about 15 when he immigrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; Secondary sources suggest that John arrived without his parents and lived, for a time, with Miles Standish, who resided in Duxbury. According to &quot;History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater,&quot; &quot;it is said, [that John] lived in Capt. Miles Standish's family,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; while Savage (writing after Mitchell) stated that John was &quot;one of the first sett. brot. up by Capt. Miles Standish.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt; === Brother James or George? ===According to &quot;History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater,&quot; John immigrated with a brother named James, who subsequently moved to Bermuda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; The &quot;Howard Genealogy,&quot; however, states that he immigrated with a brother named George.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; The source for &quot;George&quot; in the &quot;Howard Genealogy&quot; appears to be the letter referenced above by Mary Hayward to John Hayward in New England, which also references her son George Hayward and niece Sarah, also in New England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howardxvi&quot;/&gt; Some additional support for the proposition that John had a brother named George is provided by the fact that a &quot;Gorg Haward&quot; took the oath of fidelity in Barnstable, PlymouthColony in 1657,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p179&quot;/&gt; the same year that John took the oath in Bridgewater. If, as the evidence suggests, John and his brother James/George immigrated as teenagers without their parents, they may well have ended up in the care of different families, which would help explain why Georgeended up settling in Barnstable, while John settled in Duxbury and Bridgewater. ===  Residency in Duxbury; Removal to Bridgewater ===Based on the inclusion of the name of &quot;John Heyward&quot; in the 1643 listof names of males in Duxbury aged 16-60 able to bear arms,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p190&quot;/&gt; John was living in Duxbury at that date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; The town of Bridgewater started as a grant of additional land to the inhabitants of Duxbury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell9-13&quot;/&gt; John Haward was one of the original proprietors of the Duxborrow new plantation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell10-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; which supports the proposition that John Haward of Bridgewater was the same person as John Heyward of Duxbury. According to &quot;History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater&quot;and the &quot;Howard Genealogy,&quot; John moved to what would become Bridgewater about 1651.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; The Duxborrow new plantationwas incorporated as the town of Bridgewater in 1656.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR3p101&quot;/&gt; === Marriage ===John married [[Hayward-769|Martha Hayward]], daughter of Thomas Hayward.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; Her first name is confirmed by records of the division of his estate, which refer to his widow Martha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard3-4&quot;/&gt; Her identity as a daughter of Thomas Hayward is confirmed by a quitclaim by John's children of rights to property bequeathed by Peter Town to Thomas Hayward's children.&lt;ref name=&quot;MiddlesexDeeds23p398&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p293&quot;/&gt; Some family trees state that John and Martha were married on April 6,1657 in Dennis, Barnstable County. However, both the date and location seem very improbable, and no reliable sources supporting either thatdate or location have been found. Based on the estimated dates of birth of their children, John and Martha were probably married sometime in 1652-1655. Consistent with this range, Anderson states that they were married &quot;by about 1655.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; Since both John and Thomas Hayward were residents of Duxbury during that time period (and Bridgewater was not incorporated until 1656), they were probably marriedthere. === Children === John and Martha had the following children:# [[Howard-704|John]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1653-7 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1678 Sara Latham,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard6&quot;/&gt; d. 1727 in Bridgewater&lt;ref name=&quot;BrocktonVR336&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-8985|Elizabeth]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1654-8 in Bridgewater&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1676 Edward Fobes&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-6598|Sarah]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1657-61 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1679 Zaccheus Packard&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-899|James]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1660-4 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1685 Elizabeth Washburn,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; d. 1690 on the Canada Expedition&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-994|Jonathan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1664-8 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1st January 8, 1688/9 Susanna Keith in Taunton,&lt;ref name=&quot;TauntonVR2p241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; m. 2d October 8, 1691 Sarah Dean in Taunton,&lt;ref name=&quot;TauntonVR2p241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; d. in or before 1739 (date estate divided)&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-991|Ephraim]], b. 1667 in Bridgewater, m. about 1688/9 Mary Keith in Bridgewater, d.

John was selected for a number of public offices by the town of Bridgewater, including as a surveyor of the highways in 1657 and 1671,  a selectman of the town of Bridgewater in 1678 and 1690, and a deputy to the Plymouth General Court in 1678 and 1683.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; John was also a leading officer in the Bridgewater town militia. He was appointed as Ensign of the militia in 1664.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; In1676, during King Phillip's War, he led a force of 21 townsmen, whichcame upon the enemy, fought with them, and took seventeen of them alive and also much plunder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; John was promoted to Lieutenant of the town militia in 1689&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; and was referred to as Lieut.

Re: 8th generation of Wynne family at site: SarahGraves, born 1659, who married the first Jonathan Wynne, was the daughter not of Thomas but of John Graves, Thomas's son, and his wife MarySmith, daughter of Lt. Samuel Smith of Wethersfield, Connecticut. Sarah may first have married Edward Stebbins in 1679, but in 1694 marriedJonathan Wynne. How she got to PA is a mystery. She seems also to have brought a Greaves brother or cousin, as a male Greaves owned our property in 1851 and gave his name to a nearby Greaves Lane in Gladwyne.
