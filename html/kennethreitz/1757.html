He was a millwright and carpenter of note. He built many churches and was erecting the first corn mill at Mill River when he died. He was the first town clerk of Hatfield, and was one of a committee of six appointed to make a survey of and lay out highways between Hadley and Windsor, Conn. He served in King Philip’s War and was in the fight at Great Falls on May 19, 1676. Afterwards he was a captain in the militia. At the time of the Hatfield massacre on September 19, 1677,the mother of John Allis was killed, his bam burned, and his six-year- old daughter Abigail carried away to Canada by the Indians, being one of the seventeen prisoners taken. On the same day the Indians went north to Deerfield, where they killed one and captured four men, and then went across the country to Lake Champlain and Canada. During the march to Canada one of the men was burned at the stake and two other captives were killed, and all endured much suffering. The trip through the wilderness was a most difficult one. The prisoners were held in Canada by the French until ran- somed eight months later through the efforts of two of the Hatfield settlers, Benjamin Waite and Stephen Jennings, whose families wereamong the captives. The party reached Albany on May 22 and eventuallyarrived a Hatfield safely. Husband of Mary Meekins Clark Allis. Her first husband was Nathaniel Clark, and she married, third, Samuel Belding. Children: Joseph Allis, Abigail Allis Wells, Hannah Allis Butler, Ichabod Allis, Eleazer Allis, Elizabeth Allis Bridgeman, Lydia Allis, John Allis Jr, Rebecca Allis Graves, William Allis, Mary Allis, and Nathaniel Allis. === Name ===: Name:  Captain John /Allis/&lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#S-2083067515]]  Page:  Source number: 493.000; Source type: Electronic Database; Number of Pages: 1; Submitter Code: TLB.

I have transcribed the dates exactly as they are shown in the book. After the first page or two of writing out the husband's name followed by the wife'sgiven name, &quot;his wife&quot;, I placed both given names before the surname to shorten the file. Entries are often not in sequential order by date, but are entered in the order in which they appear in the book.'' &lt;BR&gt; It is worth noting that entries before and after William's entry listunambiguously use a day month year format. Based on this, his DOB would be 10th day of November 1655.  However, since this was an area of  Quakers/Puritans; the date in their format/conventions (until 1752) would render this date as '''11 month''' .11th month would be January, since their calendar starts with March as the first month of the year.  William's birth year would run from March 1655 to February 1656. So, his DOB would be 10 January 1656, assuming a Quaker date format in the record. This date was used in this profile, absent other sources.  &lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#OR01]] Dates. &lt;/ref&gt; ===Death=== 1676  &lt;ref name=&quot;cite-02&quot;&gt;{{FindAGrave|37515786}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;BR&gt; ===Burial=== ~20 May 1676 &lt;ref name=&quot;cite-02&quot;/&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Falls Fight Gravesite &lt;ref name=&quot;cite-02&quot;/&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Greenfield, Franklin County, Massachusetts, USA &lt;BR&gt; Plot: . &lt;BR&gt; Find A Grave Memorial# 37515786 &lt;ref name=&quot;cite-02&quot;/&gt; ==Sources== &lt;references /&gt; See also: ===Books===# [&lt;span id='B01'&gt;B01&lt;/span&gt;] Wells, D.
