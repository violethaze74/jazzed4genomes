Entries are often not in sequential order by date, but are entered in the order in which they appear in the book.'' &lt;BR&gt; It is worth noting that entries before and after William's entry listunambiguously use a day month year format. Based on this, his DOB would be 10th day of November 1655.  However, since this was an area of  Quakers/Puritans; the date in their format/conventions (until 1752) would render this date as '''11 month''' .11th month would be January, since their calendar starts with March as the first month of the year.  William's birth year would run from March 1655 to February 1656. So, his DOB would be 10 January 1656, assuming a Quaker date format in the record.

Johannes apparently changed his name to John Axtell and had a family. Silas B. Axtell describes this connection in a 1952 speech he gave at a family reunion, The Axtell Heritage. He also speculates abouta possible connection back to 1327. The speech says that the monk wasWilliam's father, but the dates are too spread out for that scenario to be reasonable. Dean C. Axtell stopped in at the Family History Library in Salt Lake City (1995). According to their files, William Axtellwas born in 1587 and his father, John Axstyl, was born 1561. The monksigned the deed in 1534, so maybe the monk was William's great-grandfather.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Source S1&lt;/ref&gt; == Sources ==P1.

He was naturalized in Lancaster County on 8 March 1742. He lived on a tract of land known as the &quot;Manor of Adulhea&quot; which was part of the Tulpehocken Settlement of what would become Berks County. He was an original member of the Christ's Tulpehocken Church. Johannnes George had two known sons, Sebastian and Johannes Nicholas, both of whom eventually settled in Northumberland County, PA (in the section known as the Mahantonga Valley). :: Submitted by: Dave Becker Email address: benhur@pond.com &lt;mailto:benhur@pond.com&gt; Address: 1821 North Hills Dr. Apt. # 30 Norristown, PA 19401 :: Neuhar Chronicle Vol. III, ad 1984 by Dennis Kastens, 411 Chapel Dr., Collinsville : 1.62234 :: Johan George Brosius qualified at Philadelphia 27 Sep 1740, having arrived on the ship &quot;Lydie&quot;, his age given as 42, therefore born 1697/8 while not listed we know that at least two teenage sons and at leastone daughter came with him (PA. German Pioneers, list 90). There may have been other children and a wife but we're not sure. (the first time one is mentioned is second wife.) Not long after arrival, The GeorgeBrosius family are found settled as farmers on a 205 acre tract, located on the north east branch of Swatara Creek in Tulpehocken Twp., Lancaster Co., Pa. This became part of the new Berks Co. in 1752. George received his patent on 5 Dec 1750, Paten Bk A, Vol 14, Pg 533, land office, Harrisburg, Pa. on 12 May 1743, he signed and agreement in support of the new Christ Lutheran Church near Stouchburg. He appears on the Tulpehocken Tax List 1754 &amp; 1755 with &quot;two married sons.&quot; (from 1762, John George Brosius and wife Catharine convey their tract of 205 acres to (son) Sebastian Brosius, consideration 150 pounds. (They confirmthe deed 6 Aug 1764). This was considerable below the actual value, and we can be sure there was a separate agreement to support George &amp; Catharine for the balance of their lives, and for legacy payments to the other children. George &amp; Catherine are probably deceased, intestate,by 1773 when Sebastian Brosius family moved to Northumberland Co., and certainly deceased by 17 Apr 1774, when the homestead was conveyed by Sebastin &amp; wife, Margaretha (Roth) to Thomas Kurr, consideration 720pounds.

Berks was notformed until 1752. George was one of the original members of the Christ Tulpehocken church. His name was on the first list, for the years of 1742-46. The family settled in the area known as &quot;The Manor of Adulhea&quot;, granted to Richard Penn. The &quot;Manor&quot; was part of the Tulpehocken settlement of what would become Berks Co. A Land grant of 205 acres was patented to Hans George Brosius, dated Dec 5, 1750. This property lay east of the present village of Rehrersburg, Tulpehocken Twp. adjoining the Altalaha Church property. The neighboring township of Bethel was to the north of the base of the Blue Mountains. :: The Tulpehocken tax lists of 1752-56 included the names of George Brosius and two married sons.

While he was imprisoned at Albany, NY, Sylvia's mother took their family to Lunenburg, Upper Canada.  They were joined by Ephraim in 1784 at Stormont Township. :She met William Merrick in 1788 after his arrival from the United States, by way of Sorel, Province of Quebec.  They married that same year, when she was fourteen years old.  As the daughter of a United Empire Loyalist, Sylvia was entitled to a significant land claim. :They first went to Elizabethtown (now Brockville), where she remained while her husband looked at land for their homestead.  William chosea spot north of the Rideau River, close to where a fellow Loyalist had settled, in Montague Township.  He and his neighbour (some sources say cousin, others a partner) began to build a mill at a location on the river known today as Merrickville. :Sylvia (Comstock) Merrick joined her husband on the banks of the Rideau River in 1796, with their growing family.  They had three childrenat this time, but would eventually have a family of seven. :Her husband died in 1844.  Sylvia died in 1848.  They are buried together in Union Cemetery, at the foot of Collar Hill. ===Birth and Early Life=== :Bork in born March 23, 1774, Her father died when she was young. (3)and upon the death of her father and her mother’s re-marriage she became the step-daughter of Ephraim Eyres. During the Revolutionary Wars, Ephraim Eyres was a Loyalist spy and for his efforts in support of the British he was captured and jailed in Albany NY. (1): It appears during his imprisonment, his wife was allowed “go forward” with some of her property and family perhaps as far as Lunenburg, Ontario (Stormont Township, near Cornwall). Following the peace settlement in 1783, Ephraim escaped prison or was released and he headed north to Canada arriving to join his wife in 1784 at Stormont which atthe time was a “staging area” for new United Empire Loyalists awaiting receipt of land claims and entitlements. (1) Meanwhile millwright William Merrick arrived in Canada at Sorel, Quebec during the summer of 1788 (2) and traveled up the St. Lawrence fromSorel to Lunenburg where the same year he encountered and married Ephraim’s daughter Sylvia Comstock. Perhaps with several of own children, Ephraim was anxious to get his step daughter off his hands for Sylvia appears to have been only 14 or 15 years old at the time of her marriage to 28 year old William !! (3) Merrick, who was a late arriving Loyalist with no apparent record of service on behalf of the British inthe American Revolution, had nothing but a basic property claim to look forward to, whereas Sylvia as the daughter of a British Revolutionary war hero was entitled to petition for a substantial land entitlement. Ephraim Eyres himself was granted property in Elizabethtown (1) and Sylvia and William followed to the burgeoning settlement which would become Brockville. But millwright William Merrick was determined to finda sight for a new mill and as early as 1790 he began to explore the country north of the St. Lawrence with a partner Roger Stephens (also a1776 war veteran with substantial land entitlements). Together they struck the Rideau from Irish Creek, traveled down river to the “GreatFall” a sight they chose for their first lumber mill and soon a grist mill. Meanwhile back in Elizabethtown Sylvia was occupied with a new family&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ontario Births and Baptisms, 1779-1899,&quot; database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:V5MG-V5Q : 10 February 2018),William Merrick, 26 May 1793; citing SAINT ANDREW'S PRESBYTERIAN,WILLIAMSTOWN,GLENGARRY,ONTARIO; FHL microfilm 928,968.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the time she joined Merrick at his new mill probably about 1796, she had given birth to three children, Charlotte, 1791, William Jr. 1793 and Charles, 1796. She was now 23 years old. While she had probably often traveled to her husband’s Merrick’s Mills it appears she continued to live in Elizabethtown, at least during the winters.(2). William Merrick died in 1844 and Sylvia followed a few years later (1848). They are both buried, together with their eldest child, Charlotte, and her husband, in Merrickville in the old cemetery at the foot ofCollar Hill. They were interred under Welsh style stone crypt and grave markers. Sylvia Comstock Merrick must certainly have been a remarkable woman. Aside from raising seven children, she was apparently of strong support to William, who was a dominant, strong-willed, determined and at times difficult individual. He was also opportunistic, generally allying himself with others who were in position to receive greater land grants and allocations than he was; all traits that made him successful as a pioneer and developer of Merrickville. But he probably was not the most gentle of men to live with. Sylvia and William Merrick had 7 children who survived to adulthood, and who as a family continued to build mills and develop the successful Village which became Merrickville. Sylvia was born in 1774. Sylvia Comstock ...  She passed away in 1848. &lt;ref&gt;Entered by Jackie Merrick, Jan 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''No more info is currently available for Sylvia Comstock.

But yet not so as that we should be wholly exempted from the fury of war, for our soil was moistened by the blood of threeSpringfield men, young Goodman (John) Dumbleton, who came to our milland two sons of Goodman Brooks, who came here to look after ye iron on ye land he had lately bought of Mr. John Pynchon Esqr., who being persuaded by Springfield folk, went to accompany them, but (they) fell in the way by the first assault ye enemy made upon us, at wch time theyburn'd Mr. Cornish's house to ashes and also John Sacket's, with his barn and what was in it, being ye first snowy day of winter (27 October); they also at this time lodged a bullet in George Granger's leg, wch was, the next morning taken out by Mr. Bulkly, and ye wound soon healed; It was judged that the enemy did receive some lose at this time, because in ye ashes of Mr. Cornish's house were found pieces of ye boanes of a man, lying about ye length of a man in ye ashes. Also in winter, some sculking Rascolds, upon a Lord's day, in ye time of or afternoon worship, fired Amb. Fowler's house and barn, and in ye week after,Walter Lee's barn; but in ye latter end and giving up of winter, ye last snowy day we had thereof, we discovering an end of Indians, did send out to make a full discovery of the same, designing onely three or four to go out, with order that they should not assalt them, but to orwoe and smart, there going 10 or 12, not as scouts, but as assailants, rid furiously upon ye enemy, from whom they received a furious charge, whereby Moses Cook, an inhabitant, and Clemence Bates, a soldier, lost their lives; Clemence in ye place and Moses at night. Besides wch we lost none of the town, onely at ye Fall's fight at Deerfield, theregoing nine from or town, 3 Garison:  Souldiers fell. Thus tho' we lay in ye very rode of ye enemy, we were preserved, onely the war had so impoverisht us that many times were we ready to leave the place, and many did, yea many of those that were in full communion in other places, for their number in all being but nine, four of them removed.&quot; John Dumbleton Jr. and Lidia/Lydia/Lidda Leonard were married on March 18, 1674/1675 in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachsuetts.&lt;ref&gt;http://ma-vitalrecords.org/MA/Hampden/Springfield/MarriagesD.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; == Sources == &lt;references /&gt; == Acknowledgments ==*Thank you to [[Saxberg-5 | Ang Saxberg]] for creating WikiTree profile Dumbleton-37 through the import of bessie1.ged on Mar 20, 2013.; <span class='c-l'>Attached To</span> <a href='143.html'>John DUMBLETON</a> b. 01/02/1650 d. 10/27/1675</td> </tr> <tr><td class='c-rd-alt'><span id='n122'>122.</span></td> <td class='c-rd-alt'>{{Puritan Great Migration}} [[Category: Springfield Cemetery, Springfield, Massachusetts]] == Biography == John Dumbleton ...

Following the peace settlement in 1783, Ephraim escaped prison or was released and he headed north to Canada arriving to join his wife in 1784 at Stormont which at the time was a “staging area” for new United Empire Loyalists awaiting receipt of land claims and entitlements. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merrickvillehistory.org/newsletters/newsletter-6-2.html Sylvia Comstock Merrick]&lt;/ref&gt; Ephraim Eyres, inasmuch as all the children claimed on him as the stepfather.

Anderson discusses the discrepancy between ages given by Alice at various depositions (calculating back to a 1602/3 birth) and her 1594 baptism, and concludes that &quot;in her eighth decade Alice chose to present herself as a younger woman, given that she was more than a decade older than William Tilley.&quot; She married first 19 Nov 1612 in Stanstead, Suffolk, Thomas Blower, by whom she had at least one son, John, baptized in Sudbury, Suffolk Feb 1627/8.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Charles Anderson, &quot;Alice (Frost) (Blower) Tilley,&quot; in ''The American Genealogist,'' vol 71 (1996), [https://www.americanancestors.org/databases/american-genealogist-the/image?volumeId=13131&amp;pageName=113&amp;rId=234373432 p 113] (membership required)&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson and others make the case that she was also mother (by Blower) of Sarah who years later called [William] Tilley father, Tilley being too young to be Sarah's father, she must have been his step daughter. She married second, in Boston, Massachusetts, shortly after 6 July 1640, William Tilley, ten years her junior. She was a prominent midwife, ran afoul of the authorities and was jailed in 1648, resulting in a number of petitions for her support signedby dozens of Boston and Dorchester women. Her husband William Tilly hired Hugh Gullison [Gunnison?] to prosecute William Philips and his wife for slandering his wife. Around this time William and Alice left Boston for Cape Porpus, Maine. There is evidence that late in their lives (1665), Alice may have left William for lack of support.  William petitioned the court who ordered that they return to living together as man and wife and that he support her. Punishment for not doing so would be 40 pounds for him and imprisonment for her. She was alive as late as 27 March 1668. == Sources == &lt;references /&gt; &lt;!-- Please edit, add, or delete anything in this text, including this note. Be bold and experiment!

An April 1714 Middlesex Co probate [citation?] gave the illusion of such a child, but subsequent research revealed this 1714 probate action was for son EDWARD. Somehow this probate involved the estateof the old man Edmund Rice Senior because essentially every one one his offspring had a descendant represented in that probate (see the Ward ca1857 Rice book, the very same book that created the false illusionof a son Edmund). The Edmund Rice (1638) Association estimates that after 13 or 14 generations, descendants of Edmund Rice may be in the many hundreds of thousands to millions. == Sources == &lt;references /&gt; See also: (remove those that are already referenced in footnotes) * Attached Documents.* [http://www.gulbangi.com/genrpts/desctwheeler.pdf  Descendants of Thomas Wheeler (9422)] * ''History of the Town of Marborough,'' Pages 240-247 * ''The American Genealogist,'' 65 (1990): page #s? * Research of [[Adamson-409|J.

His home lot was on the southwest of School and Division of the Meeting House Green. He was an old man when he died in 1645. His children were allborn in England, and all came to New England except his daughter Marywho married Mr. Rylie. His wife Joyce Baker was buried 24 May 1634 inSt. Peter's. William Frost was christened on 3 Aug 1589 in Stanstead, Suffolk, England. William married Abigail Bowser 29 Nov. 1610 at St. James in Stanstead. This is a 15th century flint pebble church with stone dressings. Thewest tower is earlier, with diagonal buttresses and a castellated parapet. : (So are we might be melding two William Frosts..because Stanstead is 200 kms from Nottingham where William’s second marriage supposedlytook place. Perhaps this is another William Frost?) William Frost married Joyse Barker at St. Mary's Church, England on 20 April 1612. The marriage was also recorded in the register of St. Nicholas Church, Nottingham.. They had at least five children including Elizabeth, our ancestor. Joyce Frost was buried 23 May 1634 (St. Peter's), Nottingham, Englandand on 23 Dec. 1634 William Frost married, at St. Peter's Church, thewidow Joane Lupton of Burton Joyce. They emigrated to Fairfield, New Haven Colony, now Connecticut.

Anderson estimates that she was born &quot;say 1635,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; apparently based on the date he estimated for her parents' marriage and for her siblings' dates of birth. However, since all those dates seem to be rough estimates and the window for her birth in 1635 is very small, it is very possible (if not likely) that Martha wasborn somewhat earlier.  Since the ''Hercules'' passenger lists statesthat Thomas and his family were from Aylesford, England, Martha was very probably born there.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Emigration to New England ===Martha and her family sailed from Sandwich, England to New England in1635 aboard the ship ''Hercules'', John Witherley, master.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hotten&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; They settled first at Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Removal to Duxbury ===Martha's family moved from Cambridge to Duxbury by 1638.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p289&quot;/&gt; === &quot;Vain, Light and Lascivious Carriage&quot; ===At a Grand Inquest on June 8, 1651, Martha Haward of Duxbury, along with John Shaw, James Shaw, Samuel Cutbert and Benjamin Eaton of Plymouth and Goodwife Gannett and William Snow of Duxbury, were presented for &quot;vaine, light and lacivius carriage at an unseasonable time of night.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR2p170&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; At the General Court at New Plymouth on October 7, 1651, the Court, &quot;not finding them alike faulty, have fined James Shaw and Goodwife Ganett thirty shillings apeace . . . and Samuell Cutbert, William Snow, Benjamine Eaton and Martha Haward are released, with admonishion to take heed of such evell carriages for the future. And as for John Shaw, he is lyable to punishment when oppertunitie serveth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR2p172&quot;/&gt; === Marriage ===Martha married John Haward/Howard.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; The first name of John Haward/Howard's wife is confirmed by records of the division of his estate, which refer to his widow Martha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard3-4&quot;/&gt; The identity of John Haward/Howard's wife as a daughter of ThomasHayward is confirmed by a quitclaim by John's children of rights to property bequeathed by Peter Town to Thomas Hayward's children.&lt;ref name=&quot;MiddlesexDeeds23p398&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p293&quot;/&gt; Some family trees state that Martha and John were married on April 6,1657 in Dennis, Barnstable County. However, both the date and location seem very improbable, and no reliable sources supporting either thatdate or location have been found. Based on the estimated dates of birth of their children, Martha and John were probably married sometime in 1652-1655. Consistent with this range, Anderson states that they were married &quot;by about 1655.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; Since both Thomas Hayward and John Haward/Howard were residents of Duxbury during that time period (and Bridgewater was not incorporated until 1656), they were probably married there. === Children === Martha and John had the following children:# [[Howard-704|John]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1653-7 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1678 Sara Latham,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard6&quot;/&gt; d. 1727 in Bridgewater&lt;ref name=&quot;BrocktonVR336&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-8985|Elizabeth]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1654-8 in Bridgewater&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1676 Edward Fobes&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-6598|Sarah]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1657-61 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1679 Zaccheus Packard&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-899|James]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1660-4 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1685 Elizabeth Washburn,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; d. 1690 on the Canada Expedition&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-994|Jonathan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1664-8 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1st January 8, 1688/9 Susanna Keith in Taunton,&lt;ref name=&quot;TauntonVR2p241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; m. 2d October 8, 1691 Sarah Dean in Taunton,&lt;ref name=&quot;TauntonVR2p241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; d. in or before 1739 (date estate divided)&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-991|Ephraim]], b. 1667 in Bridgewater, m. about 1688/9 Mary Keith in Bridgewater, d.

Lothrop asked the Major for a bell whichhung in a friary and was part of the spoils in which he intended to hang in the church at the settlement which was to become Beverly. The bell was sent to Salem in Capt. Richard More's kletch and was taken by Beverly men in More's absence without any bill of lading or payment toMore. Twenty-five years later More sued and won. Nathaniel Hayward, aged about 27, deposed that being in company with Capt. More, about twoyears ago, he told them that the bell which is at Beverly was for Capt.

Kent, -- with wife Susanna, and five children.  But he had, perhaps, been here as early as 1632, coming withWinslow, in the William and Francis, and, satisfied with prospects, went home to bring them.  Settled in Duxbury, 1638; probably at Bridgewater, 1651, being of the first proprietors, 1645; was freeman of the colony, 1646.  Had Thomas, Nathaniel, John, Joseph, Elisha, Mary, wife of Edward Mitchell, and Martha, wife of John Howard.  But of these, weare unable to discriminate which were born in England, or whether even he were that Kentish man or not.  He died 1681. == Biography == From History of Bridgewater:Thomas Esq. (son of Thomas Hayward I) was also one of the first settlers of Bridgewater, and by far the most honored and distinguished man in the place; was one of the first military officers; appointed Lieutenant 1667 and Captain 1692; was a Magistrate and one of the Governor'sAssistants, first chosen 1690, and Justice of C.C.P. and Sessions 1692; his death was occasioned by a fall from his horse, 15 Aug. 1698; heleft a wid. Sarah, but no children, he lived near where Daniel Hayward now lives. The first military officers were Josiah Standish, Lieutenant, 1660, who soon after returned to Duxbury; and Thomas Hayward, Jr., Lieutenant; and John Haward, Ensign, appointed 1664.   And in 1689 they were promoted, and Samuel Packard appointed Ensign.—Deacon John Willis was appointed to administer oaths, &amp;c., in 1660, but Capt. Thomas Hayward, Jr., was the first Magistrate in town, and one of the Governor's Council or Assistants 1690, and also a Judge of the courts; he was killed by a fall from his horse, August 15, 1698, while on a journey to Marshfield on business.—Elihu Brett was the next Magistrate, and he was also appointed a Judge of the courts 1700; he died suddenly in his chairJanuary 12th, 1712. Phillips War:   The following is an extract from an ancient manuscript, of which Comfort Willis, who then held the office of &quot;Town Trooper,&quot; is supposedto have been the author:— &quot;On Saturday, Capt. (Thomas) Hayward, Sergeant (Samuel Jr.) Packard, John Willis, and Isaac Harris, went out to see if the Indians were coming down upon them, and they saw an Indian, which made them think the enemy was at hand; and they immediately pressed Comfort Willis and Joseph Edson to go post to the Governor the same day at night to tell him of it.   And he went to Plymouth with them the next day, to send Capt. Church with his company.   And Capt. Church came with them to Monponset on the Sabbath, and came no further that day; and he told them he would meet them the next day.   And Comfort Willis and Joseph Edsoncame home at night and told their friends of it, and Ensign (John) Haward, Samuel Edson, Josiah Edson, Joseph Edson, John Washburn, Samuel Washburn, Thomas Washburn, John Field, Nicholas Byram, Samuel Allen, Samuel Allen, Jr., John Gordon, John Hayward, John Packard, John Ames, Comfort Willis, Guido Bailey, Nathaniel Hayward, John Whitman, John Packard and Samuel Leach went out on Monday, supposing to meet with Captain Church; but they came upon the enemy, and fought with them, and took seventeen of them alive and also much plunder.   And they all returned, and not one of them fell by the enemy, and received no help from Church.&quot; wikipedia:King Philip's War, sometimes called the First Indian War, Metacom's War, Metacomet's War, or Metacom's Rebellion, was an armed conflict between Native American inhabitants of present-day New England and English colonists and their Native American allies in 1675–78. The war is named after the main leader of the Native American side, Metacomet, known to the English as &quot;King Philip&quot;. Major Benjamin Church emerged as the Puritan hero of the war; it was his company of Puritan rangers andNative American allies that finally hunted down and killed King Philip on August 12, 1676. The war continued in northern New England (primarily in Maine at the New England and Acadia border) until a treaty wassigned at Casco Bay in April 1678.The war was the single greatest calamity to occur in seventeenth-century Puritan New England. In the space of little more than a year, twelve of the region's towns were destroyed and many more damaged, the colony's economy was all but ruined, and much of its population was killed, including one-tenth of all men available for military service. Morethan half of New England's towns were attacked by Native American warriors. NY Times:.....King Philip's War (or Metacom's Rebellion, for those who prefer the actual name of the Wampanoag chief). That fearsome and formative confrontation between white settlers and the New England tribes remains, per capita, America's deadliest war. In one year, one of every 10 white men of military age in Massachusetts Bay was killed, and one of every 16 in the Northeastern colonies. Two-thirds of New England towns were attacked and more than half the settlements were left in ruins. Settlers were forced to retreat nearly to the coast, and the Colonial economy was devastated.; <span class='c-l'>Attached To</span> <a href='209.html'>Thomas HAYWARD</a> b.

His place of origin is established by a record showing the enrollment for passage to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', under a minister's certification dated March 14, 1634/5, of &quot;Thos Hayward of Aylesford in Kent Taylor &amp; Susanna his Wief&quot; and children &quot;Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan, and Martha.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boys751&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Date and Place of Birth ===Thomas's date and place of birth are uncertain. Many family trees state that Thomas was born in Aylesford, Kent. Since (as established by the ''Hercules'' passenger list referenced in &quot;Origin&quot; above) Thomas was living in Aylesford before he emigrated, it is reasonably plausible that he was born there. However, no record of his birth or baptism hasbeen found. If Thomas was born and baptized in Aylesford, it is unlikely that any record of his birth or baptism will ever be found, as no records appear to exist for Aylesford, Saints Peter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aylesford&quot;/&gt; Based on his estimated date of marriage (sometime in 1620-1628), Thomas was probably born sometime in 1595-1607. Anderson estimated his date of birth as &quot;by about 1599,&quot; based on an estimated date of marriage of &quot;by about 1624.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; An estimate of &quot;about 1600&quot; seems better, however, given his 1595-1607 estimated birth range and the false precision suggested by &quot;about 1599.&quot; === Parentage ===Thomas's parentage has not been established. A number of unsourced family trees claim that Thomas was the son of a Thomas Hayward and an Agnes (Beaumon) Hayward of Aylesford, Kent. However, no reliable source has been found for that parentage or even their existence. === Marriage ===The ''Hercules'' passenger list referenced in &quot;Origin&quot; above establishes that Thomas was married to a woman named Susanna.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; As discussed in [[Towne-491|her profile]], Susanna's maiden name may have been Towne, but that is uncertain. Thomas and Susanna's date and place of marriage are uncertain. Since the ''Hercules'' passenger list establishes that Thomas and Susanna were residents of Aylesford, Kent, it is reasonably likely that they were married there or in a nearby parish. If they were married in Aylesford, it is unlikely that any marriage record will ever be found, since,as discussed above, no records appear to exist for Aylesford, Saints Peter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aylesford&quot;/&gt; Based on the fact that the ''Hercules'' passenger list shows that Thomas and Susanna had 5 children as of March 1634/5, and assuming the first child was born 1 year after their marriage and assuming a 2-year gap between births, one derives an estimated marriage date of sometime in 1624-1627. Based on the possibility of miscarriages, still births, children who died young, and longer gaps between births, they could well have been married as early as, say, 1620. Based on the possibility of twins or shorter gaps between births, they could have been married as late as 1628. Anderson estimates that they were married &quot;by about 1624,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; although this suggests that 1624 was the later end of the possible range when, instead, it appears to be a reasonable midpoint. === Emigration to New England ===As discussed above under &quot;Origin,&quot; Thomas, his wife Susanna and his five eldest children, Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan and Martha, emigrated to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', which departed Sandwich, England for New England in March 1634/5.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boys751&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; The passenger list for the ''William &amp; Francis'', which embarked at London on March 7, 1631/2 and arrived in Boston on June 5, 1632, included a &quot;Thomas Haeward.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hotten149&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GMB2p900&quot;/&gt; Savage suggested that this record might also relate to this profile's Thomas Hayward and might show that Thomas first came to New England withWinslow in 1632 and, satisfied with the prospects, went home to bringhis family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p394&quot;/&gt; Anderson found no evidence either for or against this proposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;GMB2p900&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; === Residency at Cambridge; First Record in New England ===Thomas and his family appear to have initially settled in Cambridge in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; The first known record of Thomas in New England is the grant to him on January 4, 1635 by the town of Cambridge of &quot;about 2 Acks wthin wstend ffeild gate beyond the Clay pits.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CaTR15&quot;/&gt; No further records have been found of Thomas or his family in Cambridge. === Residency at Duxbury and Bridgewater ===Thomas appears to have moved from Cambridge to Duxbury in the Plymouth Colony by 1638. The first record of Thomas at Duxbury is a grant to him by the Plymouth Colony Court of Assistant held on November 5, 1638of 10 acres of land &quot;lying on the Duxborrow side.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR1p101&quot;/&gt; He received additional grants of land in Duxbury in 1640.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR1p144&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR1p161&quot;/&gt; Thomas was admitted as a Freeman in 1647&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR2p114&quot;/&gt; and was chosen as constable of Duxbury in 1648.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR2p123&quot;/&gt; Thomas was one of the original proprietors of the Duxborrow new plantation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell10-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell26&quot;/&gt; which was incorporated as the town of Bridgewater in 1656.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR3p101&quot;/&gt; By 1658, Thomas was living in Bridgewater. He was included in lists of freemen of Bridgewater in 1658&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p202&quot;/&gt; and 1670.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR5p278&quot;/&gt; === Children === Thomas and Susanna had the following children:# [[Hayward-130|Thomas]], b. in England perhaps about 1624,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; m.

A 1954 article in TAG concluded that, contrary to the assertion in ''Dunham Genealogy'', Daniel Dunham's wife was named Hannah and thather maiden name was undetermined.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAG30p146&quot;/&gt; === Will; Death; Estate ===Thomas made his will on June 29, 1678. In his will, he described himself as &quot;Thomas Heyward Senior of Bridgwater of Bridgewater in ye Colony of New Plymouth yeoman.&quot; He made bequests to his son Joseph, son Elisha, and grandson Joseph Heyward, and mentioned lands he had previously given to his son Nathaniel. He named his son Joseph as his executor.The will was witnessed by William Brett Sr and Thomas Hayward Junr.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCW4p82&quot;/&gt; A copy of his will available at [https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-1942-31878-3161-49?cc=2018320&amp;wc=M6BX-F29:338083801 FamilySearch.org]. The inventory of Thomas's estate was taken on March 8, 1680/1 by Elder Brett and Lieutenant Hayward and totaled £46 11s 9d, with no real estate listed. The Inventory shows that he possessed &quot;Mr. Sheppards book upon ye parable of ye ten virgins and Mr. Sheppard upon ye sincere Convert.

He was the son of Johann Casper and Susannah Schneible of Northampton County Pennsylvania. He immigrated in 1748 with his parents on the ship &quot;Patience&quot; which set harbor in Philadelphia. His father was the seventeenth person to sign the usual forms atPhiladelphia Court House on September 16 1748. He married Elisabethe and was the father of Jacob Hepler and grandfather of William Hepler .George Jacob Hepler signed Oath of Allegiance in Northampton County Pennsylvania on January 23rd 1778. He signed his name as Jacob. : He fought in the Revolution along with his brothers.: Jacob at once joined the regiment under Colonel Seigfried at Bethlehem, Pa. This outfit was part of General Israel Putman's Brigade, the man who made famous the saying &quot;Don't shoot till you see the whites oftheir eyes.&quot; Casper joined Colonel Kooken's Company, Second Battalion, Northampton County, Pa. and George Hepler in the Sixth Battalion, under Captain Jacob Peterman.: Again in the Militia Rolls of 1785 appear the names of Casper Hepler, Jacob Hepler and Stoffel Hepler.: Jacob Hepler with his large family and many of his neighbors left Northampton Co. in 1785. They settled for a short time in Luzerne Co, Nescopeck Twp. Among taxables in 1790 were names like Henry, Casper, John and Adam, familar names in Western Pennsylvania, also Jacob,&amp; HenryHepler, a little later Henry &amp; George Daubenspeck. This confirms the tradition of descendants of Christian Hepler that the Hepler's came toLuzerne Co. A part of Jacob Hepler's large family was recorded in this county in the 1790 census. There were two boys over 16 years old, Christian age 20 &amp; Daniel age 18 years, five under 16 and one girl. :: Jacob had evidently traveled ahead to Allegheny Co., bringing with him 2 boys under 16 and 4 girls, making a family of 7 boys and 5 girls. In 1792 Jacob helped in the defense of the frontier against the Indians. In 1796,he began improvement on his tract of land in Buffalo Twp., northeast of the Allegheny river, on April 7, 1797 He began his improvement in July of 1796. He had the land surveyed in 1802, found that James McCoy had a warrent for the same land dated February 23 1794. Donot know how the affair was settled, but Jacob was living on this tract or part of it at the time of his death.: Jacob Hepler lived on this land in Armstrong Co. He perhaps was permitted to keep the part he had improved by 1802. In 1807 Frederick Shoop had 416 acres of James McCoy's land surveyed and encountered the same opposition as Jacob Hepler, but through some arrangement Frederick Shoop sold this land to the Harmons, Lunberrys and Blains Inc., including a portion of land occupied by Jacob Hepler. Buffalo Township became a part of Sugar Creek Township later. Jacob &amp; Elizabeth are buried in the Wilson cemetery below White Oak Cemetery in now Butler County. Anew tombstone was erected in 1941. A new Government tombstone thatwasalso erected at that time, states that Jacob was a pvt. in the 4th PaBN PA MIL REV WAR&lt;ref&gt;[http://trees.ancestry.com/tree/3770732/person/-1683298865/story/31d1e755-2edf-45e5-bd68-c243204649b3?src=search&amp;ftm=1 Source Link]&lt;/ref&gt; : Note: [[#N33]] === Marriage === : Husband:  [[Hepler-163|Georg Jacob Hepler]] : Wife:  [[Yockey-74|Elisabethe Yockey]] : Child:  [[Hepler-154|David Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-147|Christopher Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-140|Casper Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-194|Peter Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-131|Adam U Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-144|Christian Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-135|Anna Margaretha Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-150|Daniel Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-164|Georg Jacob Jr. Hepler]] :: Relationship to Father:  Natural :: Relationship to Mother:  Natural : Child:  [[Hepler-181|John B.

From 1682 to 1776 the province of Pennsylvania was the objective point of emigration fromGermany, France and Switzerland. As early as 1727 the Provincial Council of Pennsylvania passed a resolution that the masters of the vessels importing Germans and others from Europe shall be examined whether they have permission to carry these people; that a list be taken of theemigrants, the place from which they came, their occupation and theirreason for coming to America. Our immigrant Johann Casper Hepler was born July 10, 1713 and his wife Susanna Scheible December 18, 1718. :: A writing was drawn up which each emigrant must sign in his own handwriting declaring allegiance and subjection to the king of Great Britain and fidelity to the Proprietary of the Province. These ship lists are published in the &quot;Colonial Records&quot; and &quot;Rupps Immigrants&quot; and theoriginals are preserved in the Library at Harrisburg. :: It was early in 1748 when the Hoepplers - Casper, Susanna and theirfirst born Jacob,and baby Christopher set sail on the ship Patience (John Browne, Master) from Rotterdam, Holland, for the New World. The passenger list of this boat shows Casper Hepler (Hoeppler) was the seventeenth person to sign the usual forms at Philadelphia Court House, onSeptember 16, 1748. :: Although documentation is lacking to connect the above immigrant with the early settler, the family historian relates that Upper Milford Township in Northampton County was his destination. This is approximately 30 miles north of Philadelphia, in the southern part of present day Lehigh County, ten miles south of Allentown. The area is described: :: The soils of the Milfords is very productive and is well cultivated, which is the chief employment of the inhabitants. The Milfords are well-watered with the best and most wholesome water found in the LehighCounty or any county in Pennsylvania. The surface formation is very irregular, mountainous and hilly. In the southern part of Lower Milfordis the Hosensack Hill or the great Mill Hill, commonly called &quot;der Crosse Muehlberg&quot;. Although there are many acres of land untillable in the Milfords, these hills furnish fuel and timber... and are a great protection from destructive storms. :: The decision to settle here was unlikely based on proximity to market, since Philadelphia was a two-day wagon journey away. Availability of land was an important factor; since this was still frontier, property was obtainable, and 115 acres was claimed. The German language predominance and the Lutheran religion established would be additional conditons favoring settlement in then Northampton County, an area of largely German inhabitants, thus lessening the cultural shock. : : Church3 small: Dillingersville Union School &amp; Church. Casper and his family were members of this church. It was built as a church &amp; school. :: As in many early communities, the local church was a significant binding element, and it is from the records of the Evangelical Lutheran Congregation of Upper Milford (near Dillingersville) that the progressof the Hepler family is traced. The church was started about 1744. The church was abandoned about 1791. Member from this church formed the nucleus of the Lutheran Church at Zionsville. :: In 1757 a new congregation was organized at the Second Upper Milford Lutheran Congregation. This is the church at Old Zionsville and the present church is a stately old edifice with a beautifully kept cemetery. While Casper is not mentioned as one of the organizers, we find that he and his sons, Jacob and Christopher were communicants in 1765. The Reformed Church was also built in 1757. The church record book started at this time. The early history of the churches at Zionsville is somewhat confusing, but apparently there were separate Lutheran &amp; Reformed church buildings from the beginning,said to have been log structures until 1818. At that time the building had become old &amp; unsatisfactory &amp; the Lutheran congregation decided to erect a new church. A numberof the Reformed families then left the Reformed congregation &amp; joinedthe Lutherans in erecting a Union Church. The arrangement continued until 1871 at which time the Reformed members sold their interest inthebuilding &amp; rejoined the original Reformed Church. :: The genealogist in looking up baptisms at Zionsville must thereforeremember 4 places to examine records. Dillingersville and Zionsville Lutheran Church records, Reformed that separated itself &amp; the originalReformed record itself. :: The church records document at communion services, and the 1754, 1755, 1766, and 1757 rosters show Casper and Susanna Hepler (spelled Hopfeler, Hepper, Heppeler or Hoebler) present. One newborn son is mentioned---Michael Hepler (spelled Hoppler), born January 2, 1757 and baptized March 6, 1757, sponsored by Michael Scheibele and wife Barbara. Although Casper Hepler's name is listed in 1758 and 1760, the name of Susanna Hepler is no longer found after 1757 and it is presumed she diedabout this time. :: This era of six years peace and plenty was rudely broken when in 1755 General Braddock was defeated by the French and Indians in Western Pennsylvania. The red man was immediately appeared in small groups in different sections of the settlements and began a murderous warfare against the unsuspecting settlers. A report in 12-11-1755 states that 200 hostile Indians were roaming about the plantations killing settlers,and burning down their houses. Such were the trials, tribulations anddangers the first families of settlers experienced in the new land, and in the midst of them was Casper Hepler with his growing family, nowconsisting of his wife and four children, Jacob, Christopher, Casper and George. :: In 1758 Susanna Hepler no longer appears. Se probably died about this time and Casper re-married about 1762 to Anna Mary who survived him, and is mentioned in his will. :: The hardships of twenty years pioneer life told on Casper Hepler and on April 29, 1769, he made his last will and testament. When he diedis not known but the will was probated August 1, 1769, at Easton, Pa.He was only fifty-seven years old. His estate was left to his wife Anna Mary as long as she remained his widow: at her death to his sons; Jacob, two fifths, Christopher, Casper Jr. and George, each one-fifth. He also willed to the overseers of the Lutheran Church of Upper Milford, presumably the church at Zionsville- twenty shillings, which gives us a good idea of his character and integrity. Twenty shillings seems a small sum now, but then 300 acres of land could be bought for that sum. His burial place, though urgently sought, has never been found butit is most likely at Zionsville. All the old stones have been removedas they were illegible. :: Casper Hepler was a weaver of cloth and worked at his trade. His farm which he acquired in 1753 was farmed by Michael Scheible, probably his brother-in-law. Anna Mary died about 1771. for it was then that the Venue of personal property was held and final account filed. :: Jacob the oldest son sold his two-fifth portion of the home farm tohis brother Christopher, who in turn sold his share and the two shares he bought from brother Jacob to Casper. Jacob bought land in LuzerneCounty. Later Jacob relocated to Armstrong County, Pa. The youngest brother George sold his one-fifth to Casper and established a home in Whitehall Township. Christopher settled in North Carolina. : : THE WAR OF THE REVOLUTION :: In 1775 Old Man Mars again looms up in the shape of Great Britain in its last and final efforts to subdue the spirits of the colonists. At once the four sons of Casper: Jacob, Christopher, Casper Jr. &amp; George left their families of very young children to fight for their freedom against the British. :: Jacob at once joined the regiment under Colonel Seigfried at Bethlehem, Pa. This outfit was part of General Israel Putman's Brigade, the man who made famous the saying &quot;Don't shoot till you see the whites oftheir eyes&quot;. Casper joined Colonel Kooken's Company, Second Battalion, Northampton County, Pa. and George Hepler in the Sixth Battalion,under Captain Jacob Peterman. :: Again in the Militia Rolls of 1785 appear the names of Casper Hepler, Jacob Hepler and Stoffel Hepler. :: Following the war Jacob sold his two-fifth portion to his brother Christopher, and bought land in Luzerne County. He lived there for sometime, later moving and buying a farm in Armstrong County, Pa. There are thousands of Heplers living there today. :: In 1785 Christopher sold out his portion of the farm to Casper Jr. Christopher took his young family and moved to North Carolina and settled in what was then Rowan County, now Davies. They traveled in large Conestoga wagons. :: Casper Jr. bought his brother Christopher's portion of the farm in 1785. He, his wife Anna Maria and their children lived there. December9, 1795 he sold his farm to Balthaser Shultz. Casper set out in a north westerly direction to Mahantongo Township, Berks County, now EldredTownship, Schuylkill County, Pa. :: DAR records claim that George died in the war. His family at that time was living in Whitehall Township, then Northampton County, now Lehigh County, Pa. : : Johann Caspar Hepler b. 10- Jul 1713 d. 1769 : Susanna Scheible b. 18- Dec 1718 d. 1857 : : Children : Jacob Hepler 	b. 29- Jun 1744 	d. 1808 : Christopher Hepler 	b. 16- Jul 1746 	d. 1816 : Casper Hepler 	b. 20- May 1751 	d. 27- Dec 1831 : George Hepler 	b. 1755 	d. ca. 1783 : Michael Hepler 	b. 2- Jan 1757 	d. ? :: The Heplers were a very religious family and after the long trip toAmerica aboard the ship Patience, and the long trip from Philadelphiato Northampton County, I'm sure they prayed to God to give thanks fortheir safe journey. The hymn that is playing, &quot;God himself is with us&quot; probably reflects their feelings upon arriving in America.; <span class='c-l'>Attached To</span> <a href='229.html'>Johann HEPLER</a> b. 07/10/1713 d. 12/18/1769</td> </tr> <tr><td class='c-rd-std'><span id='n203'>203.</span></td> <td class='c-rd-std'>== Biography == === Birth ===03 Feb 1709 in Vaihingen.

The first record of this profile's John Haward/Heyward mentioned in secondary sources is a 1643 list of names of males in Duxbury aged 16-60 able to bear arms, which includes the name &quot;John Heyward.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p190&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; There is some evidence that there might have been two John Heywards in the Plymouth Colony. The same 1643 list of names of males aged 16-60able to bear arms includes two John Heywards: one in Plymouth&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p188&quot;/&gt; and one in Duxbury. In addition, the 1657 record of mentaking the oath of fidelity in the Plymouth Colony includes two John Hawards: one in Plymouth&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p181&quot;/&gt; and one in Bridgewater.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p185&quot;/&gt; Assuming that the same person was not listed intwo towns, it thus seems likely that there was a John Heyward/Haward of Plymouth and a John Heyward/Haward of Duxbury/Bridgewater and that the 1637 and 1642 Plymouth Colony records for John Heyward relate to the former. === Parentage; Date and Place of Birth ===John's parentage is unknown, except perhaps for the first name of hismother. The &quot;Howard Genealogy&quot; contains a copy of a letter dated August 16, 1652 by a Mary Hayward in London to her son John Hayward in NewEngland that was in the possession of a member of the Howard family and was supposedly written to this profile's John Haward/Hayward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howardxvi&quot;/&gt; (An image purportedly of the original letter is attached to this profile.) Assuming that letter is authentic and relates to this profile's John Haward/Hayward, his mother's name was Mary and she was living in London in 1652. Some family trees say that John was the son of a James Howard/Haward and a Mary Cooper, but no reliable evidence for that parentage has been found. John's date of birth is uncertain. Assuming that the secondary sources are correct and that the first record of this profile's John Haward/Heyward is the 1643 list of males of Duxborrow 16-60 years old able tobear arms (and not the earlier Plymouth records for a &quot;John Heyward&quot;), John was probably born sometime in 1623-1627 based on (i) the fact that his inclusion in the 1643 list means that he was at least 16 in 1643 and thus born no later than 1627 and (ii) the fact that the earliest estimated date of birth of one of his children (1653) suggests that he was probably not older than 30 years old at that date and thus was probably born no earlier than 1623. If, on the other hand, the 1637 record for &quot;John Heyward&quot; relates to this profiles John Haward/Heyward, he was probably born no later than 1621 (since, to volunteer for military service, he probably needed to be at least 16 years old). John's place of birth is also uncertain. It is very likely that he was born in England.  Some family trees say that John was born in Sandwich, Kent, but no reliable evidence supporting that proposition has been found. Assuming the letter referred to above is authentic and relates to this profile's John Howard, it is quite possible that he was bornin London, since his mother was living there in 1652. === Immigration to New England ===John Haward's date of immigration is uncertain and his means of immigration are unknown. Based on the assumption that John was the &quot;John Heyward&quot; included in a 1643 list of men of Duxbury, Plymouth Colony 16-60 years old able to bear arms,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p190&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; he immigrated sometime before that date. === Age at Immigration; Brought up by Miles Standish? ===Based on John's estimated date of birth (1623-1627), John was still aminor when he immigrated. This is consistent with &quot;History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater,&quot; which states that John &quot;was young when he came over,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; and with  the &quot;Howard Genealogy&quot;, which states (without support) that John was about 15 when he immigrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; Secondary sources suggest that John arrived without his parents and lived, for a time, with Miles Standish, who resided in Duxbury. According to &quot;History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater,&quot; &quot;it is said, [that John] lived in Capt. Miles Standish's family,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; while Savage (writing after Mitchell) stated that John was &quot;one of the first sett. brot. up by Capt. Miles Standish.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt; === Brother James or George? ===According to &quot;History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater,&quot; John immigrated with a brother named James, who subsequently moved to Bermuda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; The &quot;Howard Genealogy,&quot; however, states that he immigrated with a brother named George.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; The source for &quot;George&quot; in the &quot;Howard Genealogy&quot; appears to be the letter referenced above by Mary Hayward to John Hayward in New England, which also references her son George Hayward and niece Sarah, also in New England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howardxvi&quot;/&gt; Some additional support for the proposition that John had a brother named George is provided by the fact that a &quot;Gorg Haward&quot; took the oath of fidelity in Barnstable, PlymouthColony in 1657,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p179&quot;/&gt; the same year that John took the oath in Bridgewater. If, as the evidence suggests, John and his brother James/George immigrated as teenagers without their parents, they may well have ended up in the care of different families, which would help explain why Georgeended up settling in Barnstable, while John settled in Duxbury and Bridgewater. ===  Residency in Duxbury; Removal to Bridgewater ===Based on the inclusion of the name of &quot;John Heyward&quot; in the 1643 listof names of males in Duxbury aged 16-60 able to bear arms,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p190&quot;/&gt; John was living in Duxbury at that date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; The town of Bridgewater started as a grant of additional land to the inhabitants of Duxbury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell9-13&quot;/&gt; John Haward was one of the original proprietors of the Duxborrow new plantation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell10-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; which supports the proposition that John Haward of Bridgewater was the same person as John Heyward of Duxbury. According to &quot;History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater&quot;and the &quot;Howard Genealogy,&quot; John moved to what would become Bridgewater about 1651.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; The Duxborrow new plantationwas incorporated as the town of Bridgewater in 1656.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR3p101&quot;/&gt; === Marriage ===John married [[Hayward-769|Martha Hayward]], daughter of Thomas Hayward.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; Her first name is confirmed by records of the division of his estate, which refer to his widow Martha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard3-4&quot;/&gt; Her identity as a daughter of Thomas Hayward is confirmed by a quitclaim by John's children of rights to property bequeathed by Peter Town to Thomas Hayward's children.&lt;ref name=&quot;MiddlesexDeeds23p398&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p293&quot;/&gt; Some family trees state that John and Martha were married on April 6,1657 in Dennis, Barnstable County. However, both the date and location seem very improbable, and no reliable sources supporting either thatdate or location have been found. Based on the estimated dates of birth of their children, John and Martha were probably married sometime in 1652-1655. Consistent with this range, Anderson states that they were married &quot;by about 1655.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; Since both John and Thomas Hayward were residents of Duxbury during that time period (and Bridgewater was not incorporated until 1656), they were probably marriedthere. === Children === John and Martha had the following children:# [[Howard-704|John]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1653-7 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1678 Sara Latham,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard6&quot;/&gt; d. 1727 in Bridgewater&lt;ref name=&quot;BrocktonVR336&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-8985|Elizabeth]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1654-8 in Bridgewater&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1676 Edward Fobes&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-6598|Sarah]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1657-61 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1679 Zaccheus Packard&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-899|James]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1660-4 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1685 Elizabeth Washburn,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; d. 1690 on the Canada Expedition&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-994|Jonathan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1664-8 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1st January 8, 1688/9 Susanna Keith in Taunton,&lt;ref name=&quot;TauntonVR2p241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; m. 2d October 8, 1691 Sarah Dean in Taunton,&lt;ref name=&quot;TauntonVR2p241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; d. in or before 1739 (date estate divided)&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-991|Ephraim]], b. 1667 in Bridgewater, m. about 1688/9 Mary Keith in Bridgewater, d.

John was selected for a number of public offices by the town of Bridgewater, including as a surveyor of the highways in 1657 and 1671,  a selectman of the town of Bridgewater in 1678 and 1690, and a deputy to the Plymouth General Court in 1678 and 1683.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; John was also a leading officer in the Bridgewater town militia. He was appointed as Ensign of the militia in 1664.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; In1676, during King Phillip's War, he led a force of 21 townsmen, whichcame upon the enemy, fought with them, and took seventeen of them alive and also much plunder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; John was promoted to Lieutenant of the town militia in 1689&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; and was referred to as Lieut. John Haward in the records relating to his estate.&lt;ref&gt;See sources cited with respect to the administration and distribution of his estate in &quot;Death; Estate&quot; in this profile.&lt;/ref&gt; === Death; Estate ===NEHGR's 1911 ''Vital Records of Brockton'' states that John died in 1700, based on a gravestone record at North End and Ashland Cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrocktonVR336&quot;/&gt; The 1903 ''Howard Genealogy'' also states that he died in 1700, but provides no source&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard2&quot;/&gt; other than perhaps a plaque installed by his descendants on the Bridgewater Historical Society Building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howardxv&quot;/&gt; Mitchell, in his 1840 ''History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater'' apparently foundno record that established the year of his death and simply stated that he died &quot;about 1700.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; It appears reasonably likely that John actually died sometime in 1701rather than in 1700. The inventory of his estate was taken by Thomas Snell, Edward Mitchell and Joseph Hayward on September 24, 1701.&lt;ref name=&quot;EstatePapers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MD49p156-7&quot;/&gt; Since it was customary for the inventory to be taken within a month or so after the deceased's death, the date of his estate inventory suggests that John died in 1701. The inventory of John's estate included his house and homelands, about 400 additional acres of land, two servants, and over £112 owed to him in debts. The estate totaled more than £661, which was a very substantial sum for that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;EstatePapers&quot;/&gt; John died intestate.&lt;ref name=&quot;EstatePapers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard3&quot;/&gt; On October 16, 1701, Letters of Administration were granted to MarthaHaward (his widow) and John Haward (his eldest son),&lt;ref name=&quot;EstatePapers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MD49p156-7&quot;/&gt; they made oath as to the inventory,&lt;ref name=&quot;EstatePapers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MD49p156-7&quot;/&gt; and they agreed to adivision of the estate with his heirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MD49p156-7&quot;/&gt; The division of the estate made allocations to: his widow Martha; eldest son John Haward; second surviving son Jonathan Haward; youngest son Ephraim Haward; James Haward, the only son of deceasedson James Haward, and his two sisters; Edward Fobes and his wife Elizabeth; Zacheus Packard and his wife Sarah; and Henry Kingman and his wife Bethiah.

Mary _____ (some say Rice); she survived him (he died in 1672). ==Biography== ==NOTE Jan, 2015==John Maynard II, the first immigrant ancestor, settled in Sudbury (now Wayland) and was one of the forty-seven who shared the meadow along the Sudbury River. His house lot of four acres was near those of Edmond and Henry Rice on North Street. At first, he built a low loghouse probably with a thatched roof and later a frame house. John was evidently desirous to locate in a fertile spot where cattle could be fed and ahome maintained. John was admitted a freeman on May 20,1644 and was select man of Sudbury in 1646. John II's first wife was Judith Starr. When she died in 1642, John later remarried her sister, Mary in 1645. In early records and histories, there are several conflicting accounts of John Maynard. There are claims of two men of the same name in the area and one account of them being married to the same Mary Starr. Most account have the familes of John II and John III confused. I believe that John of Sudbury can be proven and that the account of another event settles the John II/ John III confusion. In 1660, the inhabitants of Sudbury petitioned the General Court, stating that as the Lord had blessed them with very large families and had also greatly prospered them by increasing their flocksand herds, they found themselves much hampered for room for their cattle to feed. On May 31, 1660, a grant of six square miles was set off for their needs and this country was known as Whippin and afterwards in corporated as Marlborough. In this grant, John Maynard II was assigned a good area in the central part of the present city of Marlborough.John III went to this grant and settled, and married Mary Gates. In his father's will, he stated that he had already deeded this property to John III. Thus all the descentants by the name of Maynard in Marlborough, Southboro, Westborough and Shewsbury come from John III, while most of the families in Framingham and various parts of Sudbury and Wayland come from John, the II. John Maynard died in Sudbury on December 10, 1672. His will was datedSeptember 4, 1672 and proved April 1, 1673. In it are mentioned his eldest son John Maynard, son Zachery, wife Mary, daughter Elisabeth wife of Joseph Graves, daughter Lydia wife to Joseph Moore, and youngest daughter Mary, not yet married. His wife Mary and son Zachery were named joint executors. &quot;My trusty friends Deacon John Haines, and Joseph Noys both of Sudbury&quot; were to be supervisors to assist the executors. The will was witnessed by Henry Locker and John Toll.[5] The inventoryof the estate was taken December 30, 1672 by Edmund Goodenow, John Haines, and Joseph Noyes and came to 263 pounds.

Mathew instructed that Hannah receive his house and land to use for her natural life after which it wasto go to Mathew Crowfoot the son of James Crowfoot of Danbury, Connecticut. It is not known when Hannah passed away but it is obviously after July 16, 1718 in Springfield.

John of St. David's the father of the four Myricks who came to New England, however, no proof is given and he admits that: &quot;This is pure assumption, as no record of John's children has as yet been found... this writer bequeaths this, with many other unsolved riddles, to the successor whom he hopes and believes will some time revise, correct, and enlarge the present work&quot;.(&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) Tradition states that James and his younger brother John (b.c.1614) came from St. David's, Pembrokeshire and that they arrived in America in 1636 on the &quot;James&quot; but, they are not listed on the shipping lists and no authority is given for this statement. James and John were early inhabitants of Charlestown, MA where John was granted a house lot in 1644. The grant to James has not been found but, he owned land there before 1649 since it is mentioned as a bound in that year. In 1655/6 the bounds of his and John's lands were finally settled. James was a cooper and fish-monger owning a wharf in Charlestown. John was also a cooper and he attached the wharf of Henry Kemble because Henry had taken a son of his and withheld a writing (John had apprenticed his son to Henry). James testified about 1653, aged forty years, that John Smith took mackerel at the house of Edward Johnson and on 22 May 1653 he again testified in court aged 40 years. Before 1657 James moved to Newbury where he remained for some years and where most of his children were born. On 13 May 1657 John Andrews of Charlestown purchased land there from &quot;James Mirack, Cooper and Margerite his wife.&quot; After the birth of his last child in 1670 James moved to Boston but, returned to Newbury before 1681. Later his son James Jr. went to Boston to live. On 25 Oct. 1676 James Sr. of Boston sold to James Jr. his house lot in Newbury with all of the household goods for £40. James Jr. was also to receive from his brother the last year's rent of 40/. James Jr. of Newbury then sold the house to William Ellsby of Newbury for £40 15 June 1679. I James Myrick senior of Boston… doe resigne over all my right… that I have in a houselott… in Newbury… with all the household stuff therein… my said sonne James Myrick shall… have… the premises above mentioned…. James Myrick is to pay unto his said ffather JamesMyrick the full Sum of forty pounds… within two years… and to Demand of his Brother the last yeares rent, the sum of forty shillings”  The deed is dated 25 Oct. 1676 and was witnessed by Josiah Cobham and John Fernside.(&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) I James Mirick Junr of Newbury… for Forty Pounds… do… sell… unto William Ellsly of Newbury… that house &amp; land wc I… bought of my ffather Mirick”.  The deed is dated 15 June 1679.(&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) In 1681 John Atkinson (daughter Sarah's husband) sued Sarah Stickney for slander in the Essex County Court. The testimonies in this case prove that Sarah was the daughter of James and not his sister as stated by some.

Receiver of Excise. Lieutenant&lt;ref&gt;[[#S76|Colket]]: p.195&lt;/ref&gt;:: `William Merrick, the oldest of the four brothers who reached Charlestown in the good ship 'James' in the spring of 1636, was born in Wales in 1603. Of his early life nothing is known. He was a farmer by occupation after reaching the colony; what trade or avocation he had followed in Wales is not known. That his instincts and tastes inclined him toward a military life appear in the fact that he served for six years, after his arrival in the colony, in the colonial militia under Captain Miles Standish. He was spoken of first as an Ensign, and later asa Lieutenant. That he gave all his time and attention to his militarydueits seems to be indicated by the fact that he was not married until 1642, which was at the end of his six years' term of service. He appears to have had property both at Eastham and Duxbury. He was probablymarried at Eastham, but the destruction of a part of the first book of records of that town renders it impossible to determine this fact definitely. He certainly lived in both Eastham and Duxbury, within the decade from 1637 to 1647, as some of his children were born at Eastham during that time, and yet he is reported as being a citizen of Duxtury. The records relate that he was a citizen of Duxbury in 1636; was allotted 5 Acres of land 'next the Glade at Powder Point;' in 1637 he wasallotted another 20 acres at Great Head; he was one of the original proprietors of Bridgewater. He was Surveyor of Highways in 1646, and Constable in 1647. He married at Eastham in 1642, Rebecca, whose surnameis not known. He became a legal voter in Eastham May 22, 1655, which is the time when he took up his permanent residence in that town, his other visits having probably been with his wife's family. He had ten children born to him by Rebecca, who died in 1668 at Eastham. `Paige, in his history of Hardwick, dwells upon the fact that he was so old as to seem rather the grandfather than the father of his own family. He says: 'William Merrick, the father, was a Lieutenant, residing in Eastham. In his will, dated December 3, 1686, and proved March 6, 1688/9, he is described as 'about 86 years of age,' by which it would seem thathe was about 43 years old when the first of his 10 children was born,and he might seem to be the grandfather of this family rather than the father, were it not that he names his wife, Rebecca and his children, Stephen and William, in his will.' '&lt;ref&gt;[[#S407|Merrick]]: pages not recorded. check&lt;/ref&gt; : Ancestry :: The Welsh Progenitors of the Merrick Family in America :::::: That the Merricks of America are descended from the purest Celticstock, is established upon the best of authorities, to-wit, Burke's Peerage. Without attampting to refer to the original authorities from which the editors of the &quot;Peerage&quot; compile their family histories, an impossibility to any one not acquainted with the ancient Welsh language, and not in touch with the British Museum with its wealth of historical data, we may assume that whatever bears the imprint of &quot;Burke&quot; is historically correct. It is the accepted authority in all matters relating to the ancient families of Great Britain. We shall therefore content ourselves with quoting from &quot;Burke's Peerage,&quot; edition of 1887, page 946, et seq., as follows: :::::: &quot;The Meyricks are of the purest and noblest Cambrian blood, and have possessed the same ancestral estate and residence at Bodorgan, Anglesey, Wales, without interruption above a thousand years. They have the rare distinction of being lineally descended both from the sovereign Princes of Wales of the Welsh royal family, and from King Edward I.,whose eldest son was the first Prince of Wales of the English royal family. :::::: &quot;Cadvan (Catamanus), descended from a long line of regal ancestors, was King of North Wales at the end of the 6th century, and had his palace at Aberffraw. He fought at Bangor Iscoed, and is supposed to have been killed there, and buried at Bardsey. His grandson - :::::: &quot;King Cadwaladr, a chivalrous and illustrious Prince, founded thechurch of Llangwaladr, A. D. 650 - the parish church of Bodorgan, which is still the family seat, near Aberffraw, which became a sanctuary.He removed thither the romains of King Cadvan, which were reburied ina stone coffin. The lid of the coffin with the following original description, still legible, is now affixed to the wall inside the church.- &quot;Catamanus Rex, sapientissimus, opinatissimus omnium Regum;&quot; i.e. ...... :::::: note: get the rest of this for the record. **map**&lt;ref&gt;[[#S407|Merrick]] Page: p. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; : Event: :: Type: Will - abs :: 03 DEC 1686 Eastham, Barnstable Co., MA:: Note: The will of &quot;Ensigne william merrick Senior of Eastham he being about Eighty Six years of Age and being often Sick and weake: yet now throw the mercy of God in Sum good measure of health, &quot; was dated 3 December 1686 (This date was first written &quot;1688&quot;, but the second &quot;8&quot; was changed to &quot;6&quot;.)

His late marriage may be due to the probable fact that he came asan indentured servant,perhaps to work out the cost of his passage. Evidence of this is afforded by several records which show that the Colony arranged, between 1661 and 1666 for the purchase of land at Saconett [later Little Compton, R.I.] to accommodate the claim of former servants and others, 'due unto them by covenant.'. William Merrick was among those who thus became an original proprietor of Little Compton, though he never lived there [Plymouth Colony Records, 3:216; 4:18, 97, 128, 136; 5:125-6]. :::::: &quot;He was propounded for freeman, 5 June 1651, but was not actuallysworn as a freeman until 1 June 1658, although he took the oath of fidelity at Duxbury in 1657. His original grant of five acres from Plymouth, Oct. 1636, was 'next to the glade on Powder Point,' and just a year later he received another twenty acres on 'Greenes Harbor Payth.' This placed his residence in the bounds of Duxbury, which became a separate town in 1637. He seems to have lived there at least until 1646, but after he moved to Eastham, the births of all his children, startingin 1643, were entered in the Eastham record. :::::: &quot;He served on petit juries in 1643-5, 1648-9, 1652 and 1658; on grand juries in 1644, 1658 and 1684; as a surveyor of highways at Duxbury in 1646; probably as a Constable there in 1647; and as receiver of excise in Eastham in 1668. :::::: &quot;His military service was of greater importance. He was a Privateunder Captain Standish in and probably before 1643, Sergeant in 1649,and Ensign for a considerable period before 1663, when he was made lieutenant of the Eastham company. He was retired from this rank the following year because of age. :::::: &quot;The will of 'Ensigne william merrick Senior of Eastham he being about Eighty Six years of age and being often Sick and weake,' was made 3 Dec 1686 and proved 6 Mar 1688/9. He named his wife Rebecca; eldest son William; son Stephen' and 'all my Children my Grand Child Ruf freeman to have an equal share amongst the rest of my Children.'

E. Nadeau, 1985, William was born about 1615, which conflicts with G. B. Merrick's 1603. I am accepting the newer information at this time, and since I am in correspondence with Mr. Nadeau, will attempt to query himon this.:: Note: Genealogical &amp; Family History of the State of New Hampshire,v.2; pp.889-890. ::: ::: Mayflower Source Records; p.503.:: Note: 'William Merrick was an early resident of Eastham. He came over to this country before 1636; settled first within the limits of Old Duxbury, and had land granted him by the Colonial court near the path to 'Green Harbor' in 1637; also land granted him adjoining Mr. William Collier's, in 1630. In 1643, he was a juror for Duxbury, and in 1646 was a surveyor of highways. In 1648, he was on the jury that tried Mrs. Alice Bishop for the murder of her little daughter at Plymouth....In 1652, he was admitted a freeman, and not long after moved to Eastham. He was among the settlers there May 2, 1655, as appears by the ancient records of that township. He settled within the limits of the present town of Orleans, in that part called Skaket. Among his neighbors were Richard Knowles, John Freeman and Robert Wixon. The date of the earliest entry respecting granting of land to him at Eastham is not clear. In 1659, the records show that he had a lot granted him of about 4 acres adjoining 'Robard Wixon,' denominated a 'house lott' by the highway, with the small piece of meadow within his fence, showing he had improved the lot previous to the grant; also this year a tract of upland at Pocke, near 'Robard Wixon's' tract, containing a bout 15 acres, was granted him; also meadow at 'Little Namskaket,' 'Rock Harbor,' and at 'Boat Meadow;' together with another tract of 8 acres, as 'his great lot,' on the south side of the 'Cove.' In 1662, he was, with 'other ancient freemen and old servants,' chosen to look out for land for hisaccommodation, provided Saconet Neck was not purchased, in another locality. In 1666, he was allowed to purchase land. Mr. Merrick was appointed in 1663 Lieutenant of the trained band at Eastham, an office which had long been held by Lieut. Joseph Rogers. He was succeeded by Lieut. Rogers in 1664. Mr. Merrick at this date was beyond the age of 60,and was thereby disqualified by law to do military duty. He had been ensign of the trained band for some time. He is mentioned in the records as 'Ensign Merrick.' He held no other important office while a resident of Eastham. He was a surveyor in 1665, and receiver of excise in 1668. 'The date of his marriage does not occur in the Plymouth Colony records or the ancient records of Eatham. He undoubtedly was married in this country some few years after his arrival. His wife at the time of his death was Rebecca, but whether she was the mother of all of hischildren, the writer is not informed. He died at Eastham the last of the year 1688, or the beginning of 1689, as his will was presented forprobate at Barnstable in March, 1689. He was about 86 years old when he made his will, the year previous. Mr. Merrick, as far as is known, had 10 children: 6 sons and 4 daughters.'&lt;ref&gt;[[#S129|Smith]]: No. 32,pp. 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;:: Note: William Merrick, born about 1600-3, perhaps in Wales, is said to have ocme to New England with the usual &quot;three brothers&quot; in the &quot;James&quot; in the spring of 1636. While proof of this statement has not been found, he was certainly here before October of that year, at which time he received a grant of land in Plymouth and answered an action inCourt there. Comment has been occasioned by the fact that he did not marry until 1642, after which date he had ten children, to whom his age made him sem more like a grandfather than a father and there has been voiced a suggestion that he may have been bound for six years of military service and not free to marry until it was completed, but no lawor ruling justifying such a theory has been seen. It seems much more probable that he came as a servant to some more prosperous colonist and was bound, therefore, to work for a term of years in return for the cost of his voyage, in which case he would have to wipe out this debt by &quot;working out his freedom&quot; before he would be able t omarry. Stong color is given to this theory, as well as evidence of the patience sometimes required before promises of grants of land were finally fulfilled, by certain interlocking facts shown in a series of actions by the Plymouth Court, as (a), on June 4, 16651, when &quot;Libertie is granted unto some whoe were formerly servants whoe have land due unto them by covenant, to nominate some psons to the Court or to some of the majestrates, to be deputed in their behalfe to purchase a pcell of land for theire accomodations att Saconett&quot; [then in Massachusetts but later Little Compton, Rhode Island]; (b), on June 3, 1662, when Captain Willett was appointed &quot;to purchase the land of the Indians which is graunted unto such that were servants and others that were ancient freemen ... that the abovesaid servants and ancient freemen shall have liberty, in case they cannot procure Saconett Necke according to the graunt, to looke out some other place, undisposed of, for theire accomodation. Theire names are as followeth: ... William Merrick ..., (c), on June 7, 1665, when discussion occurred &quot;conserning the land att Saconett, in reference unto the petitioners for it called ancient servants ..., (d), onJune 5, 1666, when &quot;the ancient servants ... shall either bee accomodated att Saconett, according to a former graunt, or on the south-side of Weymouth ... [see map on p. 373] and in case they have it att the latter place, thet they shall have fifty acrees apeece ... betwixt thisdate and November next;&quot; (e), on October 31, 1661, when William Merrick and another who had apparently been tentatively assigned to the Weymouth vicinity, &quot;incase they be not accomodated with land amongst themwith whom they are listed neare the Bay line that they may looke out for accomodation elswher; or incase that Saconett can be purchased of the Indians, that then the said pties may have there portions of land there, if they please; and finally, (f), on July 4, 1673, when bounds were named at Saconett for the grant to the &quot;old servants,&quot; a committee was appointed to locate thes elimits and a requirement was made thatthe &quot;old servants ... shall make theire appeearance att Plymouth ont he twenty second of this psent July, then and theire to make out theire right, and also pay such dispursements as shall nessesarily be required, or otherwise loose theire right.&quot; :::::: Twenty-nine men, including William Merrick, comlied with this order on this date and thus became the original proprietors of what is now Little Compton, Rhode Island, although at this time no one had settled there, but few did for some years to come and it is quite certain that neighte William nor his immediate family ever did so. He owned lotnumber twelve and until 1681 or perhaps 1687 the proprietors' meetings were held at Duxbury because the majority of them still lived in that vicinity. :::::: A group of conflicting statements which are hard to harmonize andyet, fromtheir source, quite as hard to contradict, relate to the delayed acquisition of freemanship by &quot;William Merrick&quot; of which name there is no other adult than our William seen at that period. His name was included in a list of those &quot;Ppounded to take up theire Freedom&quot; [see Appendix, p. 853] on June 5, 1651; was still so listed on June 3, 1652, yet he was not admitted and sworn a freeman until June 1, 1658, although in the meanwhile he was counted among the legal voters of Eastham on May 22, 1655, and had taken the oath of fidelity at Duxbury in 1657. Since he had so lately become a freeman, the term &quot;ancient freeman&quot; [see (b)] could hardly have pertained to him, in reference to the personnel of the grantees of Saconett, and the logical deduction then is that he was one of the &quot;old servants,&quot; meaning one who came over early. Nor need the term &quot;servant&quot; cause any great uneasiness in the minds of those who carry descent from such a one,for in those days any manof means who came to New England brought with him a group of young men or young women, or both, to aid in claring the land and in providingand keeping a home, and these were often young relatives or neighbors' children and frequently of the same or similar social standing as their employer. :::::: While seeming discrepancy of statement is found as to the place of residence of William, the matter is clarified by recognition of the fact that while he first appeared as a resident of Plymouth, received from that town a grant of five acres &quot;next to the glade on Powder Point&quot; in October, 1636, and another of twenty acres on &quot;Greenes Harbor Payth&quot; in October, 1637 [see map on p. 685], this placed him without removal on his part, in what became Duxbury in the latter year. In 1646 he was using two acres of meadow rented for two years from Abraham Pearse of Duxbury; on July 26, 1649, he and John Vobes paid four pounds sterling to George Partridge for five acres at &quot;poulder point&quot; and on that date he, called Sergeant, having &quot;formerly been in partnership withJohn Vobes abovesaid in a house and parcel of upland Containing aboutfifteene acars bee it more or les,&quot; sold his portion to Vobes for L12sterling. As an inhabitant of Duxbury he automatically became a proprietor in 1645 in an extended grant made to that town, which by later subdivision became Bridgewater, but no evidence is found of his removalthereto. :::::: On October 5, 1636, William Bradford entered action of trespass against William Merrick and three others, asking L10 damages and receiving a verdict of L5 and costs. William started action against John Atwood for whom he had worked and together they agreed to submit their differences to arbitration with the result that Atwood was ordered to pay him L5 in full for &quot;moweing, makeing and stacking his hey this yeareat Greenes Harbour Marsh, save that the said Mr Atwood is to pay those that helped him to loade it into the leighter what their wages shallcome too.&quot; :::::: The public service of William Merrick was not notable but it was sufficient to show that he had the confidence ofhis townsmen for he served on petit juries in 1643-5, 1648-9, 1652 and 1658; on grand juriesin 1644, 1658 and 1684; as a surveyor of highways at Duxbury in 1646;probably as a constable there in 1647 and as a receiver of excise in Eastham in 1668. He and John Doane took an inventory of the estate of Nathaniel Mayo in 1661 and he and John Freeman witnessed the will of Josiah Cooke, Sr., and testified to it in Court in 1673. Probably his greatest public service was rendered in a military way for he was a private under Captain Standish in and probably before 1643, a sergeant in1649, an ensign for a considerable period before 1663 and, as such, he was raised to the rank of lieutenant of the Eastham military companyin that year, though replaced the following year because of age disqualification. :::::: The date of removal of William and his family to Eastham has not been proved. The registration of the births of his entire family at Eastham would ordinarily suggest that as the native town of even the eldest, but his public service in Duxbury in 1646 and probably in 1647 makes it seem more probable that one or two of his children were born atthe latter place. The identity of his wife Rebecca, whom he married about 1642, has long been unknown but late developments show her, beyond reasonable doubt, to have been the daughter of Stephen Tracy [see Tracy, p. 801]. :::::: His will, dated December 3, 1688, and changed to 1686, gave his age as about eighty-six, made his wife Rebecca executrix and left his estate for her use during her life. It also provided that what was &quot;left at my wife's decease my will is that it be equally divided amongst allmy children my Grand child Ruth Freeman to have an equal share amongst the Rest of my children.&quot; There has been an uncertainty felt in osme quarters as to the parentage of this Ruth Freeman but this document shows her mother to have been a deceased daughter of William Merrick, since Ruth herself received what wouldhave been her mother's share of the estate. Of his daughters, Sarah had married John Freeman (John, Edmond) but she had no child named Ruth and moreover she was still liingat the date of his will; no evidene is found of the marriage or even survival to maturity of Rebecca; Mary had married Stephen3 Hopkins, leaving only the daughter Ruth, who is positively stated by some, and believed by others, to have been the first wife of Edmond Freeman and the mother of this child Ruth Freeman. The record of this marriage has not been found nor that of the death of Ruth Merrick, but thegranddaughter Ruth Freeman is found in the family of Edomd3 Freeman (John2, Edmond1) and is the only person of that name in that generation. She is sometimes erroneously assigned to the second wife of Edmone3 but exhaustive study of these families justifies but the one conclusion as to themarriage of, birth of an only daughter to, and early death of Ruth (Merrick) Freeman. :::::: Rebecca, the widow of William Merrick, survivedhim and swore to the accuracy of the inventory of his property on March 6, 1688-9&lt;ref&gt;[[#S138|Dawes-Gates]]: pp. 581 - 586&lt;/ref&gt;:: Emigrated from Wales to Charleston, Massachusetts in 1636, aboard the ship &quot;James&quot;. === Name === : William Merrick&lt;ref&gt;[[#S768558122|Ancestry Family Trees]]&lt;/ref&gt; :: Suffix: Lieut. === Birth === :: 1602/1603 Wales, Llanlleschydd, St David's, Pembrokeshire :: 1603 St Davids, Pembrokeshire, Wales, England === Christening === :: Duxbury, Plymouth, Massachusetts === Arrival === :: 1636 Charlestown, Massachusetts === Ancestral File Number === :: 342V-3N === Marriage === : Wife: [[Tracy-208|Rebecca Tracy]] :: 1641/1642 Eastham, Barnstable, Massachusetts : Wife: [[Unknown-33597|Ruth Unknown]] :: abt 1684 :: 1642 Eastham, Barnstable, Massachusetts : Wife: [[Tracy-277|Rebecca Tracy]] : Child: [[Merrick-116|William Merrick]] : Child: [[Merrick-113|Stephen Merrick]] : Child: [[Merrick-107|Rebecca Merrick]] : Child: [[Merrick-118|Mary Merrick]] : Child: [[Merrick-117|Ruth Merrick]] : Child: [[Merrick-110|Sarah Merrick]] : Child: [[Merrick-119|Joseph Merrick]] : Child: [[Merrick-109|Benjamin Merrick]] : Child: [[Merrick-111|Benjamin Merrick]] === Death === :: 6 March 1689 Eastham, Barnstable, MA, === Burial === :: 1689 Eastham, Barnstable Co, Ma === Notes ===:: Immigrated from Wales with three younger brothers aboard the &quot;James&quot; in 1636.

His putative sister, Sarah Mirick, married John Atkinson at Newbury in 1646. Thomas first settled in Roxbury, then moved to Hartford, then up the Connecticut River to Agawam by 1638;&lt;ref&gt;Genealogy of the Merrick-Mirick-Meyrick Family of Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; Agawam soon became known as Springfield, Massachusetts.

His birthplace has been given as St. David's in Pembrokeshire. His birth year unclear - some sources say 1608 and others say 1620. 1620 is unlikely, because men had to be at least 21 to gain status as freemen, and most attained that status between about 25 and 30. Thomas could not have received land until he was a freeman. Since Thomas had married and received land by 1639, he had to have been born by 1618. He was also one of six men ordered toparticipate in a diplomatic mission to the Warranocke Indians &quot;to know the reasons why they said they are afraid of us&quot; in April 1638.&lt;ref&gt;Great Migration: Immigrants to New England, 1634-1635, Volume VI, R-S,p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt;It is highly unlikely that this delicate of a task wouldhave been entrusted to a teenager. From the ''Genealogy of the Merrick Family of Massachusetts'':: &quot;Thomas Merrick... came to America in the year 1636 with three brothers and probably one sister, Sarah Mirick, who married John Atkinson,at Newbury, 1646. The brothers separated, one going to Plymouth, later to Eastham, one to Newbury, and one remaining in Charlestown. ThomasMerrick is noted as having been in Roxbury in 1636... He was in Agawam [Springfield] on the 3rd day of January, 1638, according to the records of that plantation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; ''Merrick genealogy'', p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; : &quot;According to the records he was married to his first wife, Sarah, daughter of Rowland and Sarah Stebbins, July 14, 1639. She died after having borne him five children, and he married, 2d, Elizabeth Tilley, Aug. 21, 1653... By his second wife Thomas Merrick had eight children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Merrick genealogy,'' p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth died on August 21, 1684 and Thomas died twenty years later on September 7, 1704.

Until such proof is found, we are disconnecting John Moore, the immigrant, from these parents. If he was the John Moore of Henham, co. Essex,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, &quot;The English Origins of Philemon Whale,&quot; ''The Genealogist'' 6:134, 139-40)&lt;/ref&gt; then he married (1) about 1625 Elizabeth _____; he married (2) at Little Gaddesden, do. Hertford, 27 Nov 1633 Elizabeth Rice, daughter of Henry and Elizabeth (Frost) Rice and stepdaughter of Philemon1 Whale, later of Sudbury. She was baptized at Stanstead, co. Essex, on 18 Nov 1612 and died in Sudbury, Massachusetts, on 14 Dec 1690 as &quot;widow Elizabeth Moore.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;NEHGR 17:140&lt;/ref&gt; == Life in New England == There is uncertainty about when John Moore arrived in New England. Ifthe baptism of Mary, daughter of John Moore, in Berkhamstead on 9 Jan1641/2 is that of a daughter of the immigrant, he must have arrived after that time. While the town history claims that John Moore was at the Sudbury settlement soon after it began (1638-1639),&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Sudbury'', [https://www.wikitree.com/photo/The_History_of_Sudbury.jpg Page 26]&lt;/ref&gt; the first record of his presence is in September 1642, when he bought of [[Rice-52|Edmund Rice]] (father of his soon-to-be [[Rice-53|son-in-law]]) a house and land situated in the east part of the town, in the southerly part of what is now the town of Wayland.&lt;ref name=Bolton303&gt;Bolton, Ethel Stanwood.

It was finally sold, about the time of the Revolution, by a Cambridge man,who happened at the time to be living in Sudbury, but who was not a descendant of John Moore of Sudbury. 1645: He took the oath of fidelity at Sudbury July 9 1645.&lt;ref name=Bolton303/&gt;  The same year, he bought of John Stone a dwelling house and house lot, and all other lands and meadows belonging to Stone by virtue of his right in the beginning of the plantation of Sudbury. 1653: He subscribed to the covenant of Lancaster &quot;11th first mo. 1653,&quot; and forty acres of land were laid out in his name, and the first grant of lots (1653. 30th 9mo&quot;).{{Citation Needed}} He died 6 January 1673/4.&lt;ref name=Bolton303/&gt; == Last Will &amp; Testament == His will&lt;ref&gt;Worcester Co Probate #10921&lt;/ref&gt; was dated the 25th of August 1668, and was probated the 7th of April 1674.

Fromthe [http://edmund-rice.org/ancestors.htm  Edmund Rice (1638) Family Association]: :Twice in the 20th century nationally recognized research genealogists have attempted to determine the parents and ancestors of Edmund Rice:# Mary Lovering Holman described the negative result of her search for records in the parishes near Stanstead and Sudbury, Suffolk County, England in &quot;English Notes on Edmund Rice … &quot;, ''The American Genealogist''', Volume 10 (1933/34), pp. 133 - 137. Mrs. Holman is consideredby many to be one of the best research genealogists in the 20th century.# In 1997, the Edmund Rice (1638) Association commissioned Dr. JoannaMartin, a nationally recognized research genealogist who lives in England only a few miles from Stanstead and Sudbury to search again for records of Edmund Rice's parents. Dr. Martin reported in 1999 that she found no record that identified Edmund's parents or ancestral line... :::From Mrs. Holman's paper we have an excellent record of one Henry Rice's marriage to Elizabeth Frost in November 1605 at Stanstead. Mrs. Holman also documents the baptism of Edmund's first child on 23 August 1619 at Stanstead. If this is the Henry Rice and Elizabeth Frost to which the LDS records refer, the LDS records must be erroneous... If Henry was the father of Edmund the immigrant, it would have been by an earlier wife.

The will of Peter Towne includes a bequest to his &quot;first cousins at Bridgewater&quot; Nathaniel Howard, Joseph Howard, Elisha Howard and Mary Mitchell,&lt;ref name=&quot;PeterWill&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR20p370&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM7p78&quot;/&gt; who were children of [[Hayward-270|Thomas Hayward]] and his wife Susanna.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM7p78&quot;/&gt; Some genealogists seem to have concluded that this means that Susanna, the wife of Thomas Hayward, was William Towne's sister. Foremost among these was Clarence Almon Torrey.In his 1945 TAG article ''Some Ancestral Lines of President William Howard Taft'', he stated (without sources or discussion) that Thomas Hayward married Susanna Towne.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAG22p205&quot;/&gt; In addition, the entry for Thomas Hayward's marriage in Torrey's ''New England Marriagesto 1700'' has Susanna's maiden name of &quot;[Towne]&quot; in brackets but without a question mark, indicating that, although no marriage record had been found, Torrey was confident that her maiden name was Towne. None of the sources listed by Torrey, however, provide any useful evidence for Susanna's last name beyond the language of Peter Towne's will and none, except Torrey's own 1945 TAG article and one source that explicitly relied on it, claim that her maiden name was Towne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Torreys&quot;/&gt; It is unclear why Torrey felt confident that Susanna's maiden name was Towne, as there are three (seemingly equally probable) ways inwhich Thomas and Susanna Hayward's children could have been Peter Towne's cousins:# Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna could have been the sister of WilliamTowne. In that case, Susanna's maiden name would have been Towne and the maiden name of William's wife Martha would be unknown.# Thomas Hayward could have been the sister of William Town's wife Martha. In that case, Martha's maiden name would have been Hayward and the maiden name of Thomas's wife Susanna would be unknown.# Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna could have been the sister of WilliamTowne's wife Martha. In that case, the maiden name of both Susanna and Martha would be unknown.No evidence has been found that favors one of these possibilities over another. Anderson declined to adopt Torrey's theory that the maiden name of Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna was Towne and instead concluded that the relationship between the children of Thomas and Susanna Hayward and Peter Towne has not been determined.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM7p78&quot;/&gt; === Maiden Name; Parentage ===Susanna's maiden name is uncertain. As discussed above under &quot;Relationship to William and Peter Towne,&quot; it is quite possible that she was the sister of William Towne and thus her maiden name was Towne. However, it is also quite possible, if not probable, that she was not the sister of William Towne, in which case, there would be no reason to thinkthat her maiden name was Towne and her maiden name is unknown. Even if she was William Towne's sister, her parentage would be unknown, since, as discussed in [[Towne-493|William's profile]], his parentage is unknown. === Origin ===The origin (last residence prior to emigrating to New England) of Susanna, the wife of Thomas Hayward of Duxbury and Bridgewater, was Aylesford, Kent. Her place of origin is established by a record showing theenrollment for passage to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', under a minister's certification dated March 14, 1634/5, of &quot;Thos Hayward ofAylesford in Kent Taylor &amp; Susanna his Wief&quot; and children &quot;Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan, and Martha.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boys751&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Date and Place of Birth ===Susanna's date and place of birth are uncertain. Many family trees state that Susanna was born in Aylesford, Kent. Since (as established bythe ''Hercules'' passenger list referenced in &quot;Origin&quot; above) Susannawas living in Aylesford before she emigrated, it is reasonably plausible that she was born there. However, no record of her birth or baptism has been found. If Susanna was born and baptized in Aylesford, it isunlikely that any record of her birth or baptism will ever be found, as no records appear to exist for Aylesford, Saints Peter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aylesford&quot;/&gt; Based on her estimated date of marriage (sometime in 1620-1628), Susanna was probably born sometime in 1595-1610, with &quot;about 1602&quot; as a reasonable midpoint estimate. === Marriage ===Susanna and Thomas Hayward's date and place of marriage are uncertain. Since the ''Hercules'' passenger list establishes that Susanna and Thomas were residents of Aylesford, Kent, it is reasonably likely that they were married there or in a nearby parish. If they were married inAylesford, it is unlikely that any marriage record will ever be found, since, as discussed above, no records appear to exist for Aylesford,Saints Peter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aylesford&quot;/&gt; Based on the fact that the ''Hercules'' passenger list shows that Susanna and Thomas had 5 children as of March 1634/5, and assuming the first child was born 1 year after their marriage and assuming a 2-year gap between births, one derives an estimated marriage date of sometime in 1624-1627. Based on the possibility of miscarriages, still births, children who died young, and longer gaps between births, they could well have been married as early as, say, 1620. Based on the possibility of twins or shorter gaps between births, they could have been married as late as 1628. Anderson estimates that they were married &quot;by about 1624,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; although this suggests that 1624 was the later end of the possible range when, instead, it appears to be a reasonable midpoint. === Emigration to New England ===As discussed above under &quot;Origin,&quot; Susanna, her husband Thomas, and their five eldest children, Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan and Martha, emigrated to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', which departed Sandwich, England for New England in March 1634/5.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boys751&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Residency at Cambridge, Duxbury and Bridgewater ===As discussed in the profile for her husband, [[Hayward-270|Thomas Hayward]], Susanna and her family appear to have initially settled in Cambridge in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, moved to Duxbury in the Plymouth Colony by 1638, and finally moved to Bridgewater by 1658. === Children === Susanna and Thomas had the following children:# [[Hayward-130|Thomas]], b. in England perhaps about 1624,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; m. Sarah _______,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; d.s.p. before April17, 1699&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p293&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-172|John]], b. in England perhaps about 1626,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; m. by 1661 Sarah Mitchell.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; Commonly called John of the Plain to distinguish him from John Haward/Howard, the husband of his sister Martha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell177&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-1132|Elizabeth]], b. in England perhaps about 1628,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; m.

A 1954 article in TAG concluded that, contrary to the assertion in ''DunhamGenealogy'', Daniel Dunham's wife was named Hannah and that her maiden name was undetermined.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAG30p146&quot;/&gt; === Death ===Susanna's date and place of death are uncertain. No record that establishes her death has been found. Based on the fact that she was not mentioned in her husband's will which he made on June 29, 1678,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCW4p82&quot;/&gt; she presumably died before that date. Since she and her husband were residents of Bridgewater, she presumably died there. &lt;span class=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;PCW4p82&quot;&gt;Plymouth Colony Records, Wills, Vol. 4 1683-1686, Part 1, p 82.

He married February 13, 1651 to Hester Wright, daughter of Deacon Samuel and Margaret Wright of Springfield.  Hester died April 3, 1664.  Samuel married (2nd) on December 28, 1661 to Catherine (Chapin) (Bliss) Gilbert.  Catherine was baptized at Berry Pomeroy,co. Devon in 1626; daughter of Deacon Samuel and Cicely (Penny) Chapin.  She died February 4, 1712.#Sarah was baptized at St. Mary Arches, Exeter, co Devon on August 25, 1633.  She died in Springfield on March 9, 1709.  Married to Thomas Miller at Springfield on October 12, 1649 - he was killed by the Indians at the burning of Springfield on October 5, 1675.  She married (2nd) to Edward (or Edmund) Foster who was possibly the Edward Foster who was baptized at Chipping Barnet, co. Hertford, England, on June 22, 1637; son of Edward and Dionis Foster.  He died February 22, 1719/20.  Edward's 1st wife was Hester Bliss who was born about 1640 and died at Springfield on June 12, 1683; daughter of Thomas and Margaret (Hullings) Bliss. Edward Foster testified that he came from &quot;Barnett&quot; in England on September 9, 1650. #Priscilla died at Windsor, Connecticut on October 20, 1639. By May 15, 1637 the family was living at Windsor, Connecticut where he had a land grant but sold part of it in 1642 to Thomas Newell probably because of serious financial problems.  On October 14, 1642 the court &quot;took into custody all of Thomas Marshfield's estate, goods and chattels to pay his debts,&quot; afterwhich he may have returned to England but it is far likely that he died for his wife was herafter known as &quot;Widow Marshfield&quot; when by 1649 she had moved to Springfield, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=TAG67 /&gt;Her husband had probably died shortly after his last appearance in the records of  Windsor in 1642.&lt;ref name=TAG63 /&gt;  A grant for a homelot in Springfield has not been found, indicating she may have moved to Springfield to join her married daugher whose husband had received a homelot grant.&lt;ref name=TAG67 /&gt; At court in Springfield in 1649 she, Widow Marshfield, was accused ofwitchcraft by Goodwife Parsons wife of Hugh Parsons.  The accusation was that that Widow Marshfield had caused one of the Parson's childrenand one cow to die.  It came out in testimony that this Widow Maarshfield was the same as wife of Thomas Marshfield who had previously lived in Widsor, Connecticut.  At the time of these court proceedings, Widow Marshfield had three children, one of which was married and had a child. &lt;ref name=TAG63 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TAG67 /&gt; Widow Marshfield brought the accusation to court to protect her good name and on May 30, 1649 the court ruled in her favor.  Goodwife Parsons was order to pay L3 to the widow Marshfield or else be whipped twenty lashes.  She payed the fine rather than the whipping.&lt;ref name=TAG67 /&gt; In a search for the name of widow Marshfield's son-in-law, the only man who seems likely to be him is  John Dumbleton, whose wife Mercy hadnot previously been identified.  Richardson in ''&quot;Thomas Marshfield'sWife Mercy; Did Their Daughter Mercy Marry John Dumbleton?&quot;'' found there were no other candidates except him who lived in the small town of Springfield and fit the profile he was looking for;  all other men of that age were already accounted for.  Since the Springfield vital records show no record of the daughter's marriage nor the birth of theirchild, the timeline for the events seem to be:#The eldest daughter, named Mercy, married her husband while still inWindsor.#The couple had their first born child in Springfield before the moveto Windsor.#They had their 2nd child named John, born at Springfield on January 2, 1650/1.&lt;ref name=TAG67 /&gt; Naming of the additional children of John and Mercy (Marshfield) Dumbleton is significant.  There was a 2nd daughter by the name of Mercy; two sons named Samuel after Mercy Dumbleton's brother; a third daughter named Sarah (for Mercy Dumbleton's only sister Sarah (Marshfield).  Sarah, Thomas and Mercy Marshfield's other daughter, as well as Samueltheir son, used similar naming patterns.&lt;ref name=TAG67 /&gt; The widow of Thomas Marshfield, Mercy Marshfield, died and was buriedat Springfield on September 30, 1654.&lt;ref name=TAG67 /&gt;Her given nameappears in her death record according to the research of Douglas RICHARDSON in his article at The American Genealogist.&lt;ref name=TAG67 /&gt; == Sources == &lt;references /&gt; *The American Genealogist.

The first settler who &quot;penetrated the wilds of Blockley&quot; was William Warner, of Blockley, England. He was a resident as early as 1677, having arrived before the great influx of either Welsh or English colonists. William Warner built his house on what afterwards was Forty-fifth and Westminster Avenue. He named his plantation &quot;Blockley&quot; after his home in England. He landed at Upland, now Chester. His title was confirmed by William Penn. John Warner, a brother of William, soon followed him, coming over with Penn, and settled nearby. Both were members of the first Pennsylvania Legislature. The name of Duckett, Warner, Kite and others, all early members of the Schuylkill Friends' Meeting, appear on the records at the Friends' Meeting House, Fifteenth and Race Streets, Philadelphia. Mary Warner, daughter of William Warner, married Thomas W'ynn, grandson of Dr. Thomas Wynne. &lt;ref&gt;Develin, Mrs. Dora Harvey.

After coming to America and associating with members of the Society of Friends, most of their children married into that sect, although there is no evidence that Wil- liam and Anne ever belonged to any of their meetings. Anne (Dyde) \Varner survived her husband. By his will he divided his lands between his sons, John and Isaac, and his deceased daughter's husband, James Kite and his children. His son, William, was provided for by other means. To his son, Robert, in England, he gave his estate at Draycott, \Vor- cestershire, England. His estate “Blockley” went to his widow and son, Isaac.

We know he had almost finished his medical training and was in Wrexham, Denbighshire, Wales when he became a Quaker between 1654 and 1655. He married his first wife Martha Elizabeth Buttall in 1655 in Wrexham, Denbighshire, Wales. Dr. Thomas Wynne also satisfied Dr. Walter Needham and Dr. Hollins of his competence and was duly licensed as a qualified barber-surgeon during the year 1659. We know that he had his first four children; Mary 1659, Tabitha 1661, Rebecca 1662 and Sidney 1664 all born in Wrexham, Denbighshire, Wales. Which demonstrates that Dr. Thomas Wynne was not living in the Bron Fadog probably from 1644 until 1665. But returned in time for his fifth child Hannah to be born in 1666 andJonathan Wynne to be born in 1669 at the Bron Fadog.
