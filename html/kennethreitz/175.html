This is a 15th century flint pebble church with stone dressings. Thewest tower is earlier, with diagonal buttresses and a castellated parapet. : (So are we might be melding two William Frosts..because Stanstead is 200 kms from Nottingham where William’s second marriage supposedlytook place. Perhaps this is another William Frost?). William Frost married Joyse Barker at St. Mary's Church, England on 20 April 1612. The marriage was also recorded in the register of St. Nicholas Church, Nottingham.. They had at least five children including Elizabeth, our ancestor. Joyce Frost was buried 23 May 1634 (St. Peter's), Nottingham, Englandand on 23 Dec. 1634 William Frost married, at St. Peter's Church, thewidow Joane Lupton of Burton Joyce.
