His place of origin is established by a record showing the enrollment for passage to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', under a minister's certification dated March 14, 1634/5, of &quot;Thos Hayward of Aylesford in Kent Taylor &amp; Susanna his Wief&quot; and children &quot;Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan, and Martha.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boys751&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Date and Place of Birth ===Thomas's date and place of birth are uncertain. Many family trees state that Thomas was born in Aylesford, Kent. Since (as established by the ''Hercules'' passenger list referenced in &quot;Origin&quot; above) Thomas was living in Aylesford before he emigrated, it is reasonably plausible that he was born there. However, no record of his birth or baptism hasbeen found. If Thomas was born and baptized in Aylesford, it is unlikely that any record of his birth or baptism will ever be found, as no records appear to exist for Aylesford, Saints Peter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aylesford&quot;/&gt; Based on his estimated date of marriage (sometime in 1620-1628), Thomas was probably born sometime in 1595-1607. Anderson estimated his date of birth as &quot;by about 1599,&quot; based on an estimated date of marriage of &quot;by about 1624.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; An estimate of &quot;about 1600&quot; seems better, however, given his 1595-1607 estimated birth range and the false precision suggested by &quot;about 1599.&quot; === Parentage ===Thomas's parentage has not been established. A number of unsourced family trees claim that Thomas was the son of a Thomas Hayward and an Agnes (Beaumon) Hayward of Aylesford, Kent. However, no reliable source has been found for that parentage or even their existence. === Marriage ===The ''Hercules'' passenger list referenced in &quot;Origin&quot; above establishes that Thomas was married to a woman named Susanna.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; As discussed in [[Towne-491|her profile]], Susanna's maiden name may have been Towne, but that is uncertain. Thomas and Susanna's date and place of marriage are uncertain. Since the ''Hercules'' passenger list establishes that Thomas and Susanna were residents of Aylesford, Kent, it is reasonably likely that they were married there or in a nearby parish. If they were married in Aylesford, it is unlikely that any marriage record will ever be found, since,as discussed above, no records appear to exist for Aylesford, Saints Peter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aylesford&quot;/&gt; Based on the fact that the ''Hercules'' passenger list shows that Thomas and Susanna had 5 children as of March 1634/5, and assuming the first child was born 1 year after their marriage and assuming a 2-year gap between births, one derives an estimated marriage date of sometime in 1624-1627. Based on the possibility of miscarriages, still births, children who died young, and longer gaps between births, they could well have been married as early as, say, 1620. Based on the possibility of twins or shorter gaps between births, they could have been married as late as 1628. Anderson estimates that they were married &quot;by about 1624,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; although this suggests that 1624 was the later end of the possible range when, instead, it appears to be a reasonable midpoint. === Emigration to New England ===As discussed above under &quot;Origin,&quot; Thomas, his wife Susanna and his five eldest children, Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan and Martha, emigrated to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', which departed Sandwich, England for New England in March 1634/5.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boys751&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; The passenger list for the ''William &amp; Francis'', which embarked at London on March 7, 1631/2 and arrived in Boston on June 5, 1632, included a &quot;Thomas Haeward.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hotten149&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GMB2p900&quot;/&gt; Savage suggested that this record might also relate to this profile's Thomas Hayward and might show that Thomas first came to New England withWinslow in 1632 and, satisfied with the prospects, went home to bringhis family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p394&quot;/&gt; Anderson found no evidence either for or against this proposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;GMB2p900&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; === Residency at Cambridge; First Record in New England ===Thomas and his family appear to have initially settled in Cambridge in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; The first known record of Thomas in New England is the grant to him on January 4, 1635 by the town of Cambridge of &quot;about 2 Acks wthin wstend ffeild gate beyond the Clay pits.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CaTR15&quot;/&gt; No further records have been found of Thomas or his family in Cambridge. === Residency at Duxbury and Bridgewater ===Thomas appears to have moved from Cambridge to Duxbury in the Plymouth Colony by 1638. The first record of Thomas at Duxbury is a grant to him by the Plymouth Colony Court of Assistant held on November 5, 1638of 10 acres of land &quot;lying on the Duxborrow side.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR1p101&quot;/&gt; He received additional grants of land in Duxbury in 1640.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR1p144&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR1p161&quot;/&gt; Thomas was admitted as a Freeman in 1647&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR2p114&quot;/&gt; and was chosen as constable of Duxbury in 1648.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR2p123&quot;/&gt; Thomas was one of the original proprietors of the Duxborrow new plantation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell10-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell26&quot;/&gt; which was incorporated as the town of Bridgewater in 1656.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR3p101&quot;/&gt; By 1658, Thomas was living in Bridgewater.

Anderson estimates that she was born &quot;say 1635,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; apparently based on the date he estimated for her parents' marriage and for her siblings' dates of birth. However, since all those dates seem to be rough estimates and the window for her birth in 1635 is very small, it is very possible (if not likely) that Martha wasborn somewhat earlier.  Since the ''Hercules'' passenger lists statesthat Thomas and his family were from Aylesford, England, Martha was very probably born there.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Emigration to New England ===Martha and her family sailed from Sandwich, England to New England in1635 aboard the ship ''Hercules'', John Witherley, master.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hotten&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; They settled first at Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Removal to Duxbury ===Martha's family moved from Cambridge to Duxbury by 1638.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p289&quot;/&gt; === &quot;Vain, Light and Lascivious Carriage&quot; ===At a Grand Inquest on June 8, 1651, Martha Haward of Duxbury, along with John Shaw, James Shaw, Samuel Cutbert and Benjamin Eaton of Plymouth and Goodwife Gannett and William Snow of Duxbury, were presented for &quot;vaine, light and lacivius carriage at an unseasonable time of night.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR2p170&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; At the General Court at New Plymouth on October 7, 1651, the Court, &quot;not finding them alike faulty, have fined James Shaw and Goodwife Ganett thirty shillings apeace . . . and Samuell Cutbert, William Snow, Benjamine Eaton and Martha Haward are released, with admonishion to take heed of such evell carriages for the future.

However, both the date and location seem very improbable, and no reliable sources supporting either thatdate or location have been found. Based on the estimated dates of birth of their children, Martha and John were probably married sometime in 1652-1655. Consistent with this range, Anderson states that they were married &quot;by about 1655.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; Since both Thomas Hayward and John Haward/Howard were residents of Duxbury during that time period (and Bridgewater was not incorporated until 1656), they were probably married there. === Children === Martha and John had the following children:# [[Howard-704|John]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1653-7 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1678 Sara Latham,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard6&quot;/&gt; d. 1727 in Bridgewater&lt;ref name=&quot;BrocktonVR336&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-8985|Elizabeth]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1654-8 in Bridgewater&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1676 Edward Fobes&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-6598|Sarah]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1657-61 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1679 Zaccheus Packard&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-899|James]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1660-4 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1685 Elizabeth Washburn,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; d. 1690 on the Canada Expedition&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-994|Jonathan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1664-8 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1st January 8, 1688/9 Susanna Keith in Taunton,&lt;ref name=&quot;TauntonVR2p241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; m. 2d October 8, 1691 Sarah Dean in Taunton,&lt;ref name=&quot;TauntonVR2p241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; d. in or before 1739 (date estate divided)&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-991|Ephraim]], b. 1667 in Bridgewater, m. about 1688/9 Mary Keith in Bridgewater, d.

The will of Peter Towne includes a bequest to his &quot;first cousins at Bridgewater&quot; Nathaniel Howard, Joseph Howard, Elisha Howard and Mary Mitchell,&lt;ref name=&quot;PeterWill&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR20p370&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM7p78&quot;/&gt; who were children of [[Hayward-270|Thomas Hayward]] and his wife Susanna.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM7p78&quot;/&gt; Some genealogists seem to have concluded that this means that Susanna, the wife of Thomas Hayward, was William Towne's sister. Foremost among these was Clarence Almon Torrey.In his 1945 TAG article ''Some Ancestral Lines of President William Howard Taft'', he stated (without sources or discussion) that Thomas Hayward married Susanna Towne.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAG22p205&quot;/&gt; In addition, the entry for Thomas Hayward's marriage in Torrey's ''New England Marriagesto 1700'' has Susanna's maiden name of &quot;[Towne]&quot; in brackets but without a question mark, indicating that, although no marriage record had been found, Torrey was confident that her maiden name was Towne. None of the sources listed by Torrey, however, provide any useful evidence for Susanna's last name beyond the language of Peter Towne's will and none, except Torrey's own 1945 TAG article and one source that explicitly relied on it, claim that her maiden name was Towne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Torreys&quot;/&gt; It is unclear why Torrey felt confident that Susanna's maiden name was Towne, as there are three (seemingly equally probable) ways inwhich Thomas and Susanna Hayward's children could have been Peter Towne's cousins:# Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna could have been the sister of WilliamTowne. In that case, Susanna's maiden name would have been Towne and the maiden name of William's wife Martha would be unknown.# Thomas Hayward could have been the sister of William Town's wife Martha. In that case, Martha's maiden name would have been Hayward and the maiden name of Thomas's wife Susanna would be unknown.# Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna could have been the sister of WilliamTowne's wife Martha. In that case, the maiden name of both Susanna and Martha would be unknown.No evidence has been found that favors one of these possibilities over another. Anderson declined to adopt Torrey's theory that the maiden name of Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna was Towne and instead concluded that the relationship between the children of Thomas and Susanna Hayward and Peter Towne has not been determined.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM7p78&quot;/&gt; === Maiden Name; Parentage ===Susanna's maiden name is uncertain. As discussed above under &quot;Relationship to William and Peter Towne,&quot; it is quite possible that she was the sister of William Towne and thus her maiden name was Towne. However, it is also quite possible, if not probable, that she was not the sister of William Towne, in which case, there would be no reason to thinkthat her maiden name was Towne and her maiden name is unknown. Even if she was William Towne's sister, her parentage would be unknown, since, as discussed in [[Towne-493|William's profile]], his parentage is unknown. === Origin ===The origin (last residence prior to emigrating to New England) of Susanna, the wife of Thomas Hayward of Duxbury and Bridgewater, was Aylesford, Kent. Her place of origin is established by a record showing theenrollment for passage to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', under a minister's certification dated March 14, 1634/5, of &quot;Thos Hayward ofAylesford in Kent Taylor &amp; Susanna his Wief&quot; and children &quot;Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan, and Martha.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boys751&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Date and Place of Birth ===Susanna's date and place of birth are uncertain. Many family trees state that Susanna was born in Aylesford, Kent. Since (as established bythe ''Hercules'' passenger list referenced in &quot;Origin&quot; above) Susannawas living in Aylesford before she emigrated, it is reasonably plausible that she was born there. However, no record of her birth or baptism has been found. If Susanna was born and baptized in Aylesford, it isunlikely that any record of her birth or baptism will ever be found, as no records appear to exist for Aylesford, Saints Peter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aylesford&quot;/&gt; Based on her estimated date of marriage (sometime in 1620-1628), Susanna was probably born sometime in 1595-1610, with &quot;about 1602&quot; as a reasonable midpoint estimate. === Marriage ===Susanna and Thomas Hayward's date and place of marriage are uncertain. Since the ''Hercules'' passenger list establishes that Susanna and Thomas were residents of Aylesford, Kent, it is reasonably likely that they were married there or in a nearby parish. If they were married inAylesford, it is unlikely that any marriage record will ever be found, since, as discussed above, no records appear to exist for Aylesford,Saints Peter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aylesford&quot;/&gt; Based on the fact that the ''Hercules'' passenger list shows that Susanna and Thomas had 5 children as of March 1634/5, and assuming the first child was born 1 year after their marriage and assuming a 2-year gap between births, one derives an estimated marriage date of sometime in 1624-1627. Based on the possibility of miscarriages, still births, children who died young, and longer gaps between births, they could well have been married as early as, say, 1620. Based on the possibility of twins or shorter gaps between births, they could have been married as late as 1628. Anderson estimates that they were married &quot;by about 1624,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; although this suggests that 1624 was the later end of the possible range when, instead, it appears to be a reasonable midpoint. === Emigration to New England ===As discussed above under &quot;Origin,&quot; Susanna, her husband Thomas, and their five eldest children, Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan and Martha, emigrated to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', which departed Sandwich, England for New England in March 1634/5.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boys751&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Residency at Cambridge, Duxbury and Bridgewater ===As discussed in the profile for her husband, [[Hayward-270|Thomas Hayward]], Susanna and her family appear to have initially settled in Cambridge in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, moved to Duxbury in the Plymouth Colony by 1638, and finally moved to Bridgewater by 1658. === Children === Susanna and Thomas had the following children:# [[Hayward-130|Thomas]], b. in England perhaps about 1624,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; m. Sarah _______,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; d.s.p. before April17, 1699&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p293&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-172|John]], b. in England perhaps about 1626,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; m. by 1661 Sarah Mitchell.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; Commonly called John of the Plain to distinguish him from John Haward/Howard, the husband of his sister Martha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell177&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-1132|Elizabeth]], b. in England perhaps about 1628,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; m.

A 1954 article in TAG concluded that, contrary to the assertion in ''DunhamGenealogy'', Daniel Dunham's wife was named Hannah and that her maiden name was undetermined.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAG30p146&quot;/&gt; === Death ===Susanna's date and place of death are uncertain. No record that establishes her death has been found. Based on the fact that she was not mentioned in her husband's will which he made on June 29, 1678,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCW4p82&quot;/&gt; she presumably died before that date. Since she and her husband were residents of Bridgewater, she presumably died there. &lt;span class=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;PCW4p82&quot;&gt;Plymouth Colony Records, Wills, Vol. 4 1683-1686, Part 1, p 82.
