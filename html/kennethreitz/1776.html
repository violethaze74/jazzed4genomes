He was the son of William and Thomasine Axtell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; &gt;Axtell, Carson Augustus ''[[Space:Axtell Genealogy|Axtell Genealogy]]'' (Axtell, New Bedford,Massachusetts, 1945)&lt;/ref&gt; He married about 1638 Mary Unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt; Axtell family researchers make a good case for why her maiden name was NOT Starr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axtellfamily.org/axgenea/axcheney.html Marilyn Axtell Cheney, &quot;A Myth Put to Rest&quot;] (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; ::Other sources state he married Mary Rice and that upon landing, purchased land for Mary's kin Edward Rice who arrived in the New World five years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt; Two children were born to them in England, and their baptism is recorded in St. Peter's, Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt; In October 1643, Thomas purchased five acres of land in Sudbury, Massachusetts, of Edmond Rice, who came from Berkhamstead also. This land is described as &quot;lying in ye south part of ye town-bounds, the southwest side lying to the commons and joined to the land of Edmond Rice, southward and northward to the highway leading from Sudbury to Mr. Duston's farm.&quot; This area is now in the town of Wayland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt; Thomas took the oath of fidelity July 8, 1645&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt; He died in March, 1646, and was buried the 8th of that month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt; Mary, his widow, appears to have married John Maynard, June 16, 1646. He was a widower with a boy of eight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt; After Thomas death, Edmond Rice bought back the land, six acres, and dwelling house near the spring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt; The Axtell Genalogy speculates thus: &quot;The story told in those words is short, indeed, but we are permitted to see what it stands for. The young Englishman was a soldier or at least trained to arms; he was of strong puritanical leanings, like his brother Daniel the regicide. Withhis wife and two little ones he followed his neighbor across the sea to make his home in a frontier settlement of New England. Scarcely hadhe set up his rooftree in the wilderness when hardships and exposure struck him down. With his last breath he leaves his little all for thehelpless group about his death bed&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt; === Estate&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt; === : Imprimi: : His land and house   8£ 10s : Cattle   8£ 10s : Wearing apparel and bedding with his arms   10£ : Brass and pewter   5£ === Children&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt; ===#Mary, baptized 25 Sept 1639, in Berkhamstead, England. She married John Goodnow 19 Sept 1658; and died 14 April 1704. They had 11 children. #Henry, baptized 15 Oct 1641, in Berkhamstead.#Lydia, born June 1 1644. A Mary is also listed born on this date, but Mary was already a child of Thomas. Also, John Maynard, 2nd husband,mentions daughter Lydia, wife of John Moore. There is no other Lydia in the family, that he could be speaking of. == Sources ==P1.

Son of William and Thomasine.Husband of Mary. Father of Henry, Lydia an Mary.  There is much discussion and many references here. Since he purchased land in 1643 in Sudbury, and since his second child was born in England in 1641, Thomas likely arrived in America between those dates. His ship is unkown. S2.
