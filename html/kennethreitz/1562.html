Came across book now on Google, page 1363. Re: 8th generation of Wynne family at site: SarahGraves, born 1659, who married the first Jonathan Wynne, was the daughter not of Thomas but of John Graves, Thomas's son, and his wife MarySmith, daughter of Lt. Samuel Smith of Wethersfield, Connecticut. Sarah may first have married Edward Stebbins in 1679, but in 1694 marriedJonathan Wynne. How she got to PA is a mystery. She seems also to have brought a Greaves brother or cousin, as a male Greaves owned our property in 1851 and gave his name to a nearby Greaves Lane in Gladwyne. Sarah and Jonathan are buried a half mile from our house at Merion Meeting, founded 1695.&quot; :: E-mail from Richard Bloom on 29 November 2008. === Leads ===* [https://www.wikitree.com/g2g/133318/wynn-or-wynne-for-jonathan-born-in-wales-in-1669 G2G discussion], includes information from duplicate profiles and other sources. == Sources == &lt;references /&gt; *&lt;span id='S33'&gt;S33&lt;/span&gt;: LDS, Family Search, 20 DEC 2009 * &lt;span id='S99'&gt;S99&lt;/span&gt;: Ancestry, 4 AUG 2012* &lt;span id='S49'&gt;S49&lt;/span&gt;: Ancestry Public Member Trees, 2006.
