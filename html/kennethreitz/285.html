Soon after, the events so minutely described by the Rev. Edward Taylor took place. He says: -- &quot;but summer coming, (1675):  opened a door unto yt desolating war, began by Philip Sachem of yePakaneket Indians, by which this handful was sorely pressed yet sovereignly preserved. But yet not so as that we should be wholly exempted from the fury of war, for our soil was moistened by the blood of threeSpringfield men, young Goodman (John) Dumbleton, who came to our milland two sons of Goodman Brooks, who came here to look after ye iron on ye land he had lately bought of Mr. John Pynchon Esqr., who being persuaded by Springfield folk, went to accompany them, but (they) fell in the way by the first assault ye enemy made upon us, at wch time theyburn'd Mr. Cornish's house to ashes and also John Sacket's, with his barn and what was in it, being ye first snowy day of winter (27 October); they also at this time lodged a bullet in George Granger's leg, wch was, the next morning taken out by Mr. Bulkly, and ye wound soon healed; It was judged that the enemy did receive some lose at this time, because in ye ashes of Mr. Cornish's house were found pieces of ye boanes of a man, lying about ye length of a man in ye ashes. Also in winter, some sculking Rascolds, upon a Lord's day, in ye time of or afternoon worship, fired Amb. Fowler's house and barn, and in ye week after,Walter Lee's barn; but in ye latter end and giving up of winter, ye last snowy day we had thereof, we discovering an end of Indians, did send out to make a full discovery of the same, designing onely three or four to go out, with order that they should not assalt them, but to orwoe and smart, there going 10 or 12, not as scouts, but as assailants, rid furiously upon ye enemy, from whom they received a furious charge, whereby Moses Cook, an inhabitant, and Clemence Bates, a soldier, lost their lives; Clemence in ye place and Moses at night. Besides wch we lost none of the town, onely at ye Fall's fight at Deerfield, theregoing nine from or town, 3 Garison:  Souldiers fell. Thus tho' we lay in ye very rode of ye enemy, we were preserved, onely the war had so impoverisht us that many times were we ready to leave the place, and many did, yea many of those that were in full communion in other places, for their number in all being but nine, four of them removed.&quot; John Dumbleton Jr. and Lidia/Lydia/Lidda Leonard were married on March 18, 1674/1675 in Springfield, Hampden County, Massachsuetts.&lt;ref&gt;http://ma-vitalrecords.org/MA/Hampden/Springfield/MarriagesD.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; == Sources == &lt;references /&gt; == Acknowledgments ==*Thank you to [[Saxberg-5 | Ang Saxberg]] for creating WikiTree profile Dumbleton-37 through the import of bessie1.ged on Mar 20, 2013.<br/><span id='n3'>3.</span> == Biography == &quot;Mercy Dumbleton daughter of John Dumbleton was borne the 2d day of the 1st Mon: 1652, at Springfield, Hampden, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-276]] Vol. 2, Page 1661&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Samuel Bodurtha &amp; Mercy Dumbleton were maried: April. 28. 1681&quot; at Springfield, Hampden, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-276]] Vol. 1, Page 24&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Aprill. 28th 1681* Samll Bedortha &amp; Mercy Dumbleton Joined in Mariage *Corrected from 1680.&quot; at Springfield, Hampden, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-276]] Vol. 2, Page 1651&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Mercy, the wife of Samuel Bedortha was sick and died June 16, 1689,&quot;at Springfield, Hampden, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#S-276]] Vol. 1, Page 67&lt;/ref&gt; == Sources == * Source: &lt;span id='S-276'&gt;S-276&lt;/span&gt; Title: ''Vital Records of Springfield, Massachusetts to 1850.''
