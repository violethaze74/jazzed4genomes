Ifthe baptism of Mary, daughter of John Moore, in Berkhamstead on 9 Jan1641/2 is that of a daughter of the immigrant, he must have arrived after that time. While the town history claims that John Moore was at the Sudbury settlement soon after it began (1638-1639),&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Sudbury'', [https://www.wikitree.com/photo/The_History_of_Sudbury.jpg Page 26]&lt;/ref&gt; the first record of his presence is in September 1642, when he bought of [[Rice-52|Edmund Rice]] (father of his soon-to-be [[Rice-53|son-in-law]]) a house and land situated in the east part of the town, in the southerly part of what is now the town of Wayland.&lt;ref name=Bolton303&gt;Bolton, Ethel Stanwood.

It was finally sold, about the time of the Revolution, by a Cambridge man,who happened at the time to be living in Sudbury, but who was not a descendant of John Moore of Sudbury. 1645: He took the oath of fidelity at Sudbury July 9 1645.&lt;ref name=Bolton303/&gt;  The same year, he bought of John Stone a dwelling house and house lot, and all other lands and meadows belonging to Stone by virtue of his right in the beginning of the plantation of Sudbury. 1653: He subscribed to the covenant of Lancaster &quot;11th first mo. 1653,&quot; and forty acres of land were laid out in his name, and the first grant of lots (1653. 30th 9mo&quot;).{{Citation Needed}} He died 6 January 1673/4.&lt;ref name=Bolton303/&gt; == Last Will &amp; Testament == His will&lt;ref&gt;Worcester Co Probate #10921&lt;/ref&gt; was dated the 25th of August 1668, and was probated the 7th of April 1674.

On 20 Jan 1668/9 John Maynard, husbandman, gave bond of 20 pounds forthe appearance of &quot;his daughter Lidiah&quot; to answer to a charge of fornication with Joseph Moore. On 26 Jan 1668/9, Joseph Moore confessed to fornication with Lydia Maynard and gave bond of 20 pounds for his appearance to answer the charge, with Jacob Moore (his brother) and Henry Rice as sureties. On 28 Jan 1668/9, Joseph Moore was summoned to answer for fornicationwith Lydia Maynard. Lydia married [[Moore-4393|Joseph Moore]] between 28 Jan 1668/9 (whenstill single, charged with fornication with each other, and she was no doubt pregnant) and 14 Apr 1669 when their son Benoni was born (Sudbury vital records); she is most definitely married by 5 Oct 1669 by which time the records refer to her as &quot;Lydia Maynard now Moore&quot;. She died 23 NOV 1717 Sudbury, Middlesex, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Sudbury Vital Records, Deaths, p 317&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 Oct 1669, petition by Elizabeth Moore, mother of Joseph, and Mary Maynard, mother of Lydia Maynard now Moore, seeking that the imposition of corporeal punishment for fornication on their children be relieved, and a fine imposed instead. The court minutes of the period are missing, so we do not know when the charge was first made, what exactlythe penalty was, or whether the petition of the mothers was respected. &lt;ref&gt;Neil D. Thompson, &quot;Lydia Maynard, Wife of Joseph Moore of Sudbury MA,&quot; in ''The American Genealogist,'' 60(1984):53-55&lt;/ref&gt; === Note ===Note:  (or Mary). The Sudbury Vital Records gives both names on the same date, born June 1, 1644. In his will, John Maynard speaks of his daughter Lydia, wife of John Moore, and as there is no record of any other Lydia in his family, it seems probable that the daughter of his wife by her first husband,Thomas Axtell, is intended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; &gt;Axtell, Carson A.
