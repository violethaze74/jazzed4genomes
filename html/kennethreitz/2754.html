Johannes apparently changed his name to John Axtell and had a family. Silas B. Axtell describes this connection in a 1952 speech he gave at a family reunion, The Axtell Heritage. He also speculates abouta possible connection back to 1327. The speech says that the monk wasWilliam's father, but the dates are too spread out for that scenario to be reasonable. Dean C. Axtell stopped in at the Family History Library in Salt Lake City (1995). According to their files, William Axtellwas born in 1587 and his father, John Axstyl, was born 1561. The monksigned the deed in 1534, so maybe the monk was William's great-grandfather.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Source S1&lt;/ref&gt; == Sources ==P1.
