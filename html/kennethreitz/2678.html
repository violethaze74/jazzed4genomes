I have transcribed the dates exactly as they are shown in the book. After the first page or two of writing out the husband's name followed by the wife'sgiven name, &quot;his wife&quot;, I placed both given names before the surname to shorten the file. Entries are often not in sequential order by date, but are entered in the order in which they appear in the book.'' &lt;BR&gt; It is worth noting that entries before and after William's entry listunambiguously use a day month year format. Based on this, his DOB would be 10th day of November 1655.  However, since this was an area of  Quakers/Puritans; the date in their format/conventions (until 1752) would render this date as '''11 month''' .11th month would be January, since their calendar starts with March as the first month of the year.  William's birth year would run from March 1655 to February 1656. So, his DOB would be 10 January 1656, assuming a Quaker date format in the record. This date was used in this profile, absent other sources.  &lt;ref&gt;Source: [[#OR01]] Dates. &lt;/ref&gt; ===Death=== 1676  &lt;ref name=&quot;cite-02&quot;&gt;{{FindAGrave|37515786}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;BR&gt; ===Burial=== ~20 May 1676 &lt;ref name=&quot;cite-02&quot;/&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Falls Fight Gravesite &lt;ref name=&quot;cite-02&quot;/&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Greenfield, Franklin County, Massachusetts, USA &lt;BR&gt; Plot: . &lt;BR&gt; Find A Grave Memorial# 37515786 &lt;ref name=&quot;cite-02&quot;/&gt; ==Sources== &lt;references /&gt; See also: ===Books===# [&lt;span id='B01'&gt;B01&lt;/span&gt;] Wells, D.
