Anglicans under the leadership of Mr William Roche (or Roach) had made a beginning towards erecting a church on the opposite side of the road from the present site of St Anne's in Easton's Corners, but the untimely death of Mr Roche in 1841 caused the Anglicans to postpone building.&quot;: &quot;William Roche, born July 17, 1796, died at Montreal, December 7, 1841 and is buried on the north side of the Church. This would be on his farm. His will found among the Johnstown Wills at the Archives of Ontario dated at Wolford, November 30, 1841, states that he leaves &quot;to his wife Anna, Lot 24, Concession 3, Wolford with house in which I now reside, plus part of Lot 25, Concession 3, Wolford. Lot 26, Concession3, Wolford, was to be divided equally among '''sons Leander Collins Roach and Philander Roach''' and '''daughters Olive, Amelia, Caroline''' and '''Sophia'''. Daughter '''Laura''' was to receive the East quarter of Lot 26 Concession one when she married or when she became 21 years of age. Executors were Samuel Starr Easton, Basil R Church, Anna Roach.&quot;: &quot;So when the present St Anne's Church was built in 1876 it would beon widow Anna Roach's property. It would seem the Cemetery was established at that time since inscriptions on tombstones all post - date that time with two exceptions: that of William Roche and that of three Hornick graves of 1860's which were moved from Hanton's Cemetery in Kitley to St Anne's by Stanley Hornick. &quot;: Grenville County Cemeteries, Volume 1, A Genealogical Reference Listing ISBN0-920300-77-4, by the Leeds &amp; Grenville Branch, OGS<br/><span id='n4'>4.</span> == Biography == === Children === John Roche married Ann Ryan in 1826.
