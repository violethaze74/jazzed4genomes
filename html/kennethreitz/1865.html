Receiver of Excise. Lieutenant&lt;ref&gt;[[#S76|Colket]]: p.195&lt;/ref&gt;:: `William Merrick, the oldest of the four brothers who reached Charlestown in the good ship 'James' in the spring of 1636, was born in Wales in 1603. Of his early life nothing is known. He was a farmer by occupation after reaching the colony; what trade or avocation he had followed in Wales is not known. That his instincts and tastes inclined him toward a military life appear in the fact that he served for six years, after his arrival in the colony, in the colonial militia under Captain Miles Standish. He was spoken of first as an Ensign, and later asa Lieutenant. That he gave all his time and attention to his militarydueits seems to be indicated by the fact that he was not married until 1642, which was at the end of his six years' term of service. He appears to have had property both at Eastham and Duxbury. He was probablymarried at Eastham, but the destruction of a part of the first book of records of that town renders it impossible to determine this fact definitely. He certainly lived in both Eastham and Duxbury, within the decade from 1637 to 1647, as some of his children were born at Eastham during that time, and yet he is reported as being a citizen of Duxtury. The records relate that he was a citizen of Duxbury in 1636; was allotted 5 Acres of land 'next the Glade at Powder Point;' in 1637 he wasallotted another 20 acres at Great Head; he was one of the original proprietors of Bridgewater. He was Surveyor of Highways in 1646, and Constable in 1647. He married at Eastham in 1642, Rebecca, whose surnameis not known. He became a legal voter in Eastham May 22, 1655, which is the time when he took up his permanent residence in that town, his other visits having probably been with his wife's family. He had ten children born to him by Rebecca, who died in 1668 at Eastham. `Paige, in his history of Hardwick, dwells upon the fact that he was so old as to seem rather the grandfather than the father of his own family. He says: 'William Merrick, the father, was a Lieutenant, residing in Eastham. In his will, dated December 3, 1686, and proved March 6, 1688/9, he is described as 'about 86 years of age,' by which it would seem thathe was about 43 years old when the first of his 10 children was born,and he might seem to be the grandfather of this family rather than the father, were it not that he names his wife, Rebecca and his children, Stephen and William, in his will.'

His late marriage may be due to the probable fact that he came asan indentured servant,perhaps to work out the cost of his passage. Evidence of this is afforded by several records which show that the Colony arranged, between 1661 and 1666 for the purchase of land at Saconett [later Little Compton, R.I.] to accommodate the claim of former servants and others, 'due unto them by covenant.'. William Merrick was among those who thus became an original proprietor of Little Compton, though he never lived there [Plymouth Colony Records, 3:216; 4:18, 97, 128, 136; 5:125-6]. :::::: &quot;He was propounded for freeman, 5 June 1651, but was not actuallysworn as a freeman until 1 June 1658, although he took the oath of fidelity at Duxbury in 1657. His original grant of five acres from Plymouth, Oct. 1636, was 'next to the glade on Powder Point,' and just a year later he received another twenty acres on 'Greenes Harbor Payth.' This placed his residence in the bounds of Duxbury, which became a separate town in 1637. He seems to have lived there at least until 1646, but after he moved to Eastham, the births of all his children, startingin 1643, were entered in the Eastham record. :::::: &quot;He served on petit juries in 1643-5, 1648-9, 1652 and 1658; on grand juries in 1644, 1658 and 1684; as a surveyor of highways at Duxbury in 1646; probably as a Constable there in 1647; and as receiver of excise in Eastham in 1668. :::::: &quot;His military service was of greater importance. He was a Privateunder Captain Standish in and probably before 1643, Sergeant in 1649,and Ensign for a considerable period before 1663, when he was made lieutenant of the Eastham company. He was retired from this rank the following year because of age. :::::: &quot;The will of 'Ensigne william merrick Senior of Eastham he being about Eighty Six years of age and being often Sick and weake,' was made 3 Dec 1686 and proved 6 Mar 1688/9.

I am accepting the newer information at this time, and since I am in correspondence with Mr. Nadeau, will attempt to query himon this.:: Note: Genealogical &amp; Family History of the State of New Hampshire,v.2; pp.889-890. ::: ::: Mayflower Source Records; p.503.:: Note: 'William Merrick was an early resident of Eastham. He came over to this country before 1636; settled first within the limits of Old Duxbury, and had land granted him by the Colonial court near the path to 'Green Harbor' in 1637; also land granted him adjoining Mr. William Collier's, in 1630. In 1643, he was a juror for Duxbury, and in 1646 was a surveyor of highways. In 1648, he was on the jury that tried Mrs. Alice Bishop for the murder of her little daughter at Plymouth....In 1652, he was admitted a freeman, and not long after moved to Eastham. He was among the settlers there May 2, 1655, as appears by the ancient records of that township. He settled within the limits of the present town of Orleans, in that part called Skaket. Among his neighbors were Richard Knowles, John Freeman and Robert Wixon. The date of the earliest entry respecting granting of land to him at Eastham is not clear. In 1659, the records show that he had a lot granted him of about 4 acres adjoining 'Robard Wixon,' denominated a 'house lott' by the highway, with the small piece of meadow within his fence, showing he had improved the lot previous to the grant; also this year a tract of upland at Pocke, near 'Robard Wixon's' tract, containing a bout 15 acres, was granted him; also meadow at 'Little Namskaket,' 'Rock Harbor,' and at 'Boat Meadow;' together with another tract of 8 acres, as 'his great lot,' on the south side of the 'Cove.' In 1662, he was, with 'other ancient freemen and old servants,' chosen to look out for land for hisaccommodation, provided Saconet Neck was not purchased, in another locality. In 1666, he was allowed to purchase land. Mr. Merrick was appointed in 1663 Lieutenant of the trained band at Eastham, an office which had long been held by Lieut. Joseph Rogers. He was succeeded by Lieut. Rogers in 1664. Mr. Merrick at this date was beyond the age of 60,and was thereby disqualified by law to do military duty. He had been ensign of the trained band for some time. He is mentioned in the records as 'Ensign Merrick.' He held no other important office while a resident of Eastham. He was a surveyor in 1665, and receiver of excise in 1668. 'The date of his marriage does not occur in the Plymouth Colony records or the ancient records of Eatham. He undoubtedly was married in this country some few years after his arrival. His wife at the time of his death was Rebecca, but whether she was the mother of all of hischildren, the writer is not informed. He died at Eastham the last of the year 1688, or the beginning of 1689, as his will was presented forprobate at Barnstable in March, 1689. He was about 86 years old when he made his will, the year previous. Mr. Merrick, as far as is known, had 10 children: 6 sons and 4 daughters.'&lt;ref&gt;[[#S129|Smith]]: No. 32,pp. 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;:: Note: William Merrick, born about 1600-3, perhaps in Wales, is said to have ocme to New England with the usual &quot;three brothers&quot; in the &quot;James&quot; in the spring of 1636. While proof of this statement has not been found, he was certainly here before October of that year, at which time he received a grant of land in Plymouth and answered an action inCourt there. Comment has been occasioned by the fact that he did not marry until 1642, after which date he had ten children, to whom his age made him sem more like a grandfather than a father and there has been voiced a suggestion that he may have been bound for six years of military service and not free to marry until it was completed, but no lawor ruling justifying such a theory has been seen. It seems much more probable that he came as a servant to some more prosperous colonist and was bound, therefore, to work for a term of years in return for the cost of his voyage, in which case he would have to wipe out this debt by &quot;working out his freedom&quot; before he would be able t omarry. Stong color is given to this theory, as well as evidence of the patience sometimes required before promises of grants of land were finally fulfilled, by certain interlocking facts shown in a series of actions by the Plymouth Court, as (a), on June 4, 16651, when &quot;Libertie is granted unto some whoe were formerly servants whoe have land due unto them by covenant, to nominate some psons to the Court or to some of the majestrates, to be deputed in their behalfe to purchase a pcell of land for theire accomodations att Saconett&quot; [then in Massachusetts but later Little Compton, Rhode Island]; (b), on June 3, 1662, when Captain Willett was appointed &quot;to purchase the land of the Indians which is graunted unto such that were servants and others that were ancient freemen ... that the abovesaid servants and ancient freemen shall have liberty, in case they cannot procure Saconett Necke according to the graunt, to looke out some other place, undisposed of, for theire accomodation. Theire names are as followeth: ... William Merrick ..., (c), on June 7, 1665, when discussion occurred &quot;conserning the land att Saconett, in reference unto the petitioners for it called ancient servants ..., (d), onJune 5, 1666, when &quot;the ancient servants ... shall either bee accomodated att Saconett, according to a former graunt, or on the south-side of Weymouth ... [see map on p. 373] and in case they have it att the latter place, thet they shall have fifty acrees apeece ... betwixt thisdate and November next;&quot; (e), on October 31, 1661, when William Merrick and another who had apparently been tentatively assigned to the Weymouth vicinity, &quot;incase they be not accomodated with land amongst themwith whom they are listed neare the Bay line that they may looke out for accomodation elswher; or incase that Saconett can be purchased of the Indians, that then the said pties may have there portions of land there, if they please; and finally, (f), on July 4, 1673, when bounds were named at Saconett for the grant to the &quot;old servants,&quot; a committee was appointed to locate thes elimits and a requirement was made thatthe &quot;old servants ... shall make theire appeearance att Plymouth ont he twenty second of this psent July, then and theire to make out theire right, and also pay such dispursements as shall nessesarily be required, or otherwise loose theire right.&quot; :::::: Twenty-nine men, including William Merrick, comlied with this order on this date and thus became the original proprietors of what is now Little Compton, Rhode Island, although at this time no one had settled there, but few did for some years to come and it is quite certain that neighte William nor his immediate family ever did so. He owned lotnumber twelve and until 1681 or perhaps 1687 the proprietors' meetings were held at Duxbury because the majority of them still lived in that vicinity. :::::: A group of conflicting statements which are hard to harmonize andyet, fromtheir source, quite as hard to contradict, relate to the delayed acquisition of freemanship by &quot;William Merrick&quot; of which name there is no other adult than our William seen at that period. His name was included in a list of those &quot;Ppounded to take up theire Freedom&quot; [see Appendix, p. 853] on June 5, 1651; was still so listed on June 3, 1652, yet he was not admitted and sworn a freeman until June 1, 1658, although in the meanwhile he was counted among the legal voters of Eastham on May 22, 1655, and had taken the oath of fidelity at Duxbury in 1657. Since he had so lately become a freeman, the term &quot;ancient freeman&quot; [see (b)] could hardly have pertained to him, in reference to the personnel of the grantees of Saconett, and the logical deduction then is that he was one of the &quot;old servants,&quot; meaning one who came over early. Nor need the term &quot;servant&quot; cause any great uneasiness in the minds of those who carry descent from such a one,for in those days any manof means who came to New England brought with him a group of young men or young women, or both, to aid in claring the land and in providingand keeping a home, and these were often young relatives or neighbors' children and frequently of the same or similar social standing as their employer. :::::: While seeming discrepancy of statement is found as to the place of residence of William, the matter is clarified by recognition of the fact that while he first appeared as a resident of Plymouth, received from that town a grant of five acres &quot;next to the glade on Powder Point&quot; in October, 1636, and another of twenty acres on &quot;Greenes Harbor Payth&quot; in October, 1637 [see map on p. 685], this placed him without removal on his part, in what became Duxbury in the latter year. In 1646 he was using two acres of meadow rented for two years from Abraham Pearse of Duxbury; on July 26, 1649, he and John Vobes paid four pounds sterling to George Partridge for five acres at &quot;poulder point&quot; and on that date he, called Sergeant, having &quot;formerly been in partnership withJohn Vobes abovesaid in a house and parcel of upland Containing aboutfifteene acars bee it more or les,&quot; sold his portion to Vobes for L12sterling. As an inhabitant of Duxbury he automatically became a proprietor in 1645 in an extended grant made to that town, which by later subdivision became Bridgewater, but no evidence is found of his removalthereto. :::::: On October 5, 1636, William Bradford entered action of trespass against William Merrick and three others, asking L10 damages and receiving a verdict of L5 and costs. William started action against John Atwood for whom he had worked and together they agreed to submit their differences to arbitration with the result that Atwood was ordered to pay him L5 in full for &quot;moweing, makeing and stacking his hey this yeareat Greenes Harbour Marsh, save that the said Mr Atwood is to pay those that helped him to loade it into the leighter what their wages shallcome too.&quot; :::::: The public service of William Merrick was not notable but it was sufficient to show that he had the confidence ofhis townsmen for he served on petit juries in 1643-5, 1648-9, 1652 and 1658; on grand juriesin 1644, 1658 and 1684; as a surveyor of highways at Duxbury in 1646;probably as a constable there in 1647 and as a receiver of excise in Eastham in 1668. He and John Doane took an inventory of the estate of Nathaniel Mayo in 1661 and he and John Freeman witnessed the will of Josiah Cooke, Sr., and testified to it in Court in 1673. Probably his greatest public service was rendered in a military way for he was a private under Captain Standish in and probably before 1643, a sergeant in1649, an ensign for a considerable period before 1663 and, as such, he was raised to the rank of lieutenant of the Eastham military companyin that year, though replaced the following year because of age disqualification. :::::: The date of removal of William and his family to Eastham has not been proved. The registration of the births of his entire family at Eastham would ordinarily suggest that as the native town of even the eldest, but his public service in Duxbury in 1646 and probably in 1647 makes it seem more probable that one or two of his children were born atthe latter place. The identity of his wife Rebecca, whom he married about 1642, has long been unknown but late developments show her, beyond reasonable doubt, to have been the daughter of Stephen Tracy [see Tracy, p. 801]. :::::: His will, dated December 3, 1688, and changed to 1686, gave his age as about eighty-six, made his wife Rebecca executrix and left his estate for her use during her life. It also provided that what was &quot;left at my wife's decease my will is that it be equally divided amongst allmy children my Grand child Ruth Freeman to have an equal share amongst the Rest of my children.&quot; There has been an uncertainty felt in osme quarters as to the parentage of this Ruth Freeman but this document shows her mother to have been a deceased daughter of William Merrick, since Ruth herself received what wouldhave been her mother's share of the estate. Of his daughters, Sarah had married John Freeman (John, Edmond) but she had no child named Ruth and moreover she was still liingat the date of his will; no evidene is found of the marriage or even survival to maturity of Rebecca; Mary had married Stephen3 Hopkins, leaving only the daughter Ruth, who is positively stated by some, and believed by others, to have been the first wife of Edmond Freeman and the mother of this child Ruth Freeman. The record of this marriage has not been found nor that of the death of Ruth Merrick, but thegranddaughter Ruth Freeman is found in the family of Edomd3 Freeman (John2, Edmond1) and is the only person of that name in that generation. She is sometimes erroneously assigned to the second wife of Edmone3 but exhaustive study of these families justifies but the one conclusion as to themarriage of, birth of an only daughter to, and early death of Ruth (Merrick) Freeman. :::::: Rebecca, the widow of William Merrick, survivedhim and swore to the accuracy of the inventory of his property on March 6, 1688-9&lt;ref&gt;[[#S138|Dawes-Gates]]: pp. 581 - 586&lt;/ref&gt;:: Emigrated from Wales to Charleston, Massachusetts in 1636, aboard the ship &quot;James&quot;. === Name === : William Merrick&lt;ref&gt;[[#S768558122|Ancestry Family Trees]]&lt;/ref&gt; :: Suffix: Lieut. === Birth === :: 1602/1603 Wales, Llanlleschydd, St David's, Pembrokeshire :: 1603 St Davids, Pembrokeshire, Wales, England === Christening === :: Duxbury, Plymouth, Massachusetts === Arrival === :: 1636 Charlestown, Massachusetts === Ancestral File Number === :: 342V-3N === Marriage === : Wife: [[Tracy-208|Rebecca Tracy]] :: 1641/1642 Eastham, Barnstable, Massachusetts : Wife: [[Unknown-33597|Ruth Unknown]] :: abt 1684 :: 1642 Eastham, Barnstable, Massachusetts : Wife: [[Tracy-277|Rebecca Tracy]] : Child: [[Merrick-116|William Merrick]] : Child: [[Merrick-113|Stephen Merrick]] : Child: [[Merrick-107|Rebecca Merrick]] : Child: [[Merrick-118|Mary Merrick]] : Child: [[Merrick-117|Ruth Merrick]] : Child: [[Merrick-110|Sarah Merrick]] : Child: [[Merrick-119|Joseph Merrick]] : Child: [[Merrick-109|Benjamin Merrick]] : Child: [[Merrick-111|Benjamin Merrick]] === Death === :: 6 March 1689 Eastham, Barnstable, MA, === Burial === :: 1689 Eastham, Barnstable Co, Ma === Notes ===:: Immigrated from Wales with three younger brothers aboard the &quot;James&quot; in 1636.

James and John were early inhabitants of Charlestown, MA where John was granted a house lot in 1644. The grant to James has not been found but, he owned land there before 1649 since it is mentioned as a bound in that year. In 1655/6 the bounds of his and John's lands were finally settled. James was a cooper and fish-monger owning a wharf in Charlestown. John was also a cooper and he attached the wharf of Henry Kemble because Henry had taken a son of his and withheld a writing (John had apprenticed his son to Henry). James testified about 1653, aged forty years, that John Smith took mackerel at the house of Edward Johnson and on 22 May 1653 he again testified in court aged 40 years. Before 1657 James moved to Newbury where he remained for some years and where most of his children were born. On 13 May 1657 John Andrews of Charlestown purchased land there from &quot;James Mirack, Cooper and Margerite his wife.&quot; After the birth of his last child in 1670 James moved to Boston but, returned to Newbury before 1681. Later his son James Jr. went to Boston to live. On 25 Oct. 1676 James Sr. of Boston sold to James Jr. his house lot in Newbury with all of the household goods for £40.

His birthplace has been given as St. David's in Pembrokeshire. His birth year unclear - some sources say 1608 and others say 1620. 1620 is unlikely, because men had to be at least 21 to gain status as freemen, and most attained that status between about 25 and 30. Thomas could not have received land until he was a freeman. Since Thomas had married and received land by 1639, he had to have been born by 1618. He was also one of six men ordered toparticipate in a diplomatic mission to the Warranocke Indians &quot;to know the reasons why they said they are afraid of us&quot; in April 1638.&lt;ref&gt;Great Migration: Immigrants to New England, 1634-1635, Volume VI, R-S,p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt;It is highly unlikely that this delicate of a task wouldhave been entrusted to a teenager. From the ''Genealogy of the Merrick Family of Massachusetts'':: &quot;Thomas Merrick... came to America in the year 1636 with three brothers and probably one sister, Sarah Mirick, who married John Atkinson,at Newbury, 1646. The brothers separated, one going to Plymouth, later to Eastham, one to Newbury, and one remaining in Charlestown. ThomasMerrick is noted as having been in Roxbury in 1636... He was in Agawam [Springfield] on the 3rd day of January, 1638, according to the records of that plantation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; ''Merrick genealogy'', p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; : &quot;According to the records he was married to his first wife, Sarah, daughter of Rowland and Sarah Stebbins, July 14, 1639. She died after having borne him five children, and he married, 2d, Elizabeth Tilley, Aug. 21, 1653... By his second wife Thomas Merrick had eight children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Merrick genealogy,'' p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth died on August 21, 1684 and Thomas died twenty years later on September 7, 1704.
