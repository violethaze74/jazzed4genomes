Great Migration}}[[Category: Immigrants to Massachusetts Bay Colony from England]][[Category:Moore Name Study]] ==Biography== == Origins and Wives == Seeking proof (if any) that he was the son of [[Moore-3195|John Moore]] (or [[Morse-360|Joseph Morse]]) and [[Barber-640|Dorothy Barber]] (or this [[Barber-631|Dorothy Barber]]). Until such proof is found, we are disconnecting John Moore, the immigrant, from these parents. If he was the John Moore of Henham, co. Essex,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, &quot;The English Origins of Philemon Whale,&quot; ''The Genealogist'' 6:134, 139-40)&lt;/ref&gt; then he married (1) about 1625 Elizabeth _____; he married (2) at Little Gaddesden, do. Hertford, 27 Nov 1633 Elizabeth Rice, daughter of Henry and Elizabeth (Frost) Rice and stepdaughter of Philemon1 Whale, later of Sudbury. She was baptized at Stanstead, co. Essex, on 18 Nov 1612 and died in Sudbury, Massachusetts, on 14 Dec 1690 as &quot;widow Elizabeth Moore.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;NEHGR 17:140&lt;/ref&gt; == Life in New England == There is uncertainty about when John Moore arrived in New England. Ifthe baptism of Mary, daughter of John Moore, in Berkhamstead on 9 Jan1641/2 is that of a daughter of the immigrant, he must have arrived after that time. While the town history claims that John Moore was at the Sudbury settlement soon after it began (1638-1639),&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Sudbury'', [https://www.wikitree.com/photo/The_History_of_Sudbury.jpg Page 26]&lt;/ref&gt; the first record of his presence is in September 1642, when he bought of [[Rice-52|Edmund Rice]] (father of his soon-to-be [[Rice-53|son-in-law]]) a house and land situated in the east part of the town, in the southerly part of what is now the town of Wayland.&lt;ref name=Bolton303&gt;Bolton, Ethel Stanwood. Some Descendants of John Moore of Sudbury, Mass. ''New England Historical and Genealogical Register'', vol. 57(1903), pp. 300ff [https://www.americanancestors.org/DB202/i/11719/300/23531455 americanancestors.org].&lt;/ref&gt;  By this time, he was also married to his second wife, Elizabeth-- step-daughter of Philemon Whale. :There was also a John Moore of Cambridge who owned land ''there'' aslate as 1643, and there has been an effort thus far fruitless, to prove that they were identical, but it seems doubtful, since the land owned by John Moore of Cambridge has been traced to his descendants. It was finally sold, about the time of the Revolution, by a Cambridge man,who happened at the time to be living in Sudbury, but who was not a descendant of John Moore of Sudbury. 1645: He took the oath of fidelity at Sudbury July 9 1645.&lt;ref name=Bolton303/&gt;  The same year, he bought of John Stone a dwelling house and house lot, and all other lands and meadows belonging to Stone by virtue of his right in the beginning of the plantation of Sudbury. 1653: He subscribed to the covenant of Lancaster &quot;11th first mo. 1653,&quot; and forty acres of land were laid out in his name, and the first grant of lots (1653. 30th 9mo&quot;).{{Citation Needed}} He died 6 January 1673/4.&lt;ref name=Bolton303/&gt; == Last Will &amp; Testament == His will&lt;ref&gt;Worcester Co Probate #10921&lt;/ref&gt; was dated the 25th of August 1668, and was probated the 7th of April 1674. In it he mentions: * wife Elizabeth, * eldest son son John of Lancaster; * eldest daughter Elizabeth, wife of Henry Rice; * daughter Mary, wife of Daniel Stone;* youngest daughter Lydia, wife of James Cutler, former wife of Samuel Wright; * sons William, Jacob, Joseph and Benjamin.He appoints Rev. Edmund Brown, Lt. Edmund Goodnow, and Mr. Thomas Stevens, overseers of the will.

His widow Elizabeth was named as Executrix.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; That she is daughter by a previous wife (not of John's wife ElizabethWhale, daughter of Philemon) is revealed by the will of Philemon Whale, naming his daughter's Rice children, none of which is Elizabeth (Moore) Rice. &lt;ref&gt;Ethel Stanwood Bolton, &quot;Some Descendants of John Mooreof Sudbury, Mass.,&quot; in ''NEHGS Register'' 57(1903):300; and 58(1904):176&lt;/ref&gt;.
