And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. Gen 38:27  And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb. Gen 38:28  And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first. Gen 38:29  And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez. Gen 38:30  And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah. 1 Chr 2:4  And Tamar his daughter in law bare him Pharez and Zerah. All the sons of Judah were five. Mat 1:3  And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;</td> </tr> </table> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
