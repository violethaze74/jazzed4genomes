Gen 38:29  And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez. Gen 38:30  And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah. 1 Chr 2:4  And Tamar his daughter in law bare him Pharez and Zerah.
